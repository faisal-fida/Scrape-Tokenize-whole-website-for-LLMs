About
So, how did
AllFly
come to exist in this world?
In 2014, Eric Peterson had a vision of making group air travel less complicated and more automated. The core team started out helping tour operators book group air travel (dealing with the airlines is frustrating).
It's all
about
the
people
Going Digital
The Start
In 2018, the Founders saw an opportunity. So much of group travel happens offline. Our customers wanted a digital experience and a way to keep their group trips organized. Thus, Marketplace was born. The easiest way to search, book, and manage group air contracts.
2021
Surviving Covid
In 2021, the pandemic hits, halting our progress dead in its tracks. We go dormant for almost 20 months. As travel starts to come back, we see a huge surge in the amount of requests we get to book airfare for team offsites.
2022
We Grow
In 2022, we launch version 1 of AllFly Quest -- the easiest way to allow your employees to book travel for their team offsite. We grew the number of corporate meetings we booked by over 100% YoY.
2024
We Launched Quest
In 2024, we launched our biggest product update to our corporate online booking tool, Quest. Customers began asking AllFly to handle not only their event travel, but their everyday individual corporate travel. Thus, AllFly enters a new phase it is growth -- full service travel management.

A little more about us
What its like to work with us
So many travel management companies promise you the world, and then when you sign up, you can t get a hold of anyone. With AllFly, their responsiveness shines through -- they have become an extension of our team.

Darlene Lyons

Our mission
In today s day in age, its shocking to find how much of group and corporate travel happens offline. Whether its calling the airlines for a group contract, or a Series B startup requesting flights for their next team offsite over email -- travel hasn t always been up with the times.
At AllFly, our mission is to make corporate, event, and group travel easy and online. We believe that travel happens best when great technology and user experience is met with an equal emphasis on responsiveness and service.

AllFly FAQ
What is a custom charter plane?
A custom charter plane is an aircraft rented exclusively for a specific journey, tailored to meet the unique needs and preferences of the client. Unlike scheduled airline flights, where departure times, routes, and aircraft types are predetermined, a custom charter plane allows the client to:
Choose their own departure and arrival times.
Select preferred airports.
Pick the type of aircraft that best suits their travel requirements.
Customize onboard services and amenities to enhance their travel experience.
This personalized approach provides maximum flexibility, convenience, and comfort, making it ideal for business travel, group trips, and special occasions
What's the difference between a charter flight and a scheduled flight?
The main difference lies in how the aircraft is booked and utilized. A scheduled flight refers to a commercial flight where seats are sold to the public, operating on a fixed timetable. In contrast, a charter flight involves booking an entire private jet by an individual or group, allowing for personalized scheduling and exclusive use of the aircraft.
Are charter flights cost effective?
Charter flights are generally not the most cost-effective option when compared to commercial flights. They typically have higher upfront costs due to the exclusive nature of renting the entire aircraft. However, the additional expense comes with significant benefits such as:
Time Savings:
Avoid long security lines, layovers, and delays associated with commercial flights.
Flexibility:
Set your own schedule, choosing departure and arrival times that fit your needs.
Convenience:
Access smaller airports closer to your final destination, reducing travel time.
Group Travel:
While often more expensive, the cost per person can sometimes be comparable to first-class commercial flights, especially for larger groups.
Customized Services:
Enjoy personalized services and amenities tailored to your preferences.
Although charter flights are not the most cost-effective option, the added value in terms of time, convenience, and personalized experience can make them worthwhile for those seeking a premium travel solution.
Will booking a charter flight save money for my group of 200 travelers?
Booking a charter flight may not necessarily save money for your group of 200 travelers. While charter flights offer benefits such as flexible scheduling and customized itineraries, they can also be more expensive than purchasing individual tickets on commercial flights. Factors like aircraft type, distance, and additional services can drive up costs. It's important to compare the total costs of charter flights with those of traditional commercial flights to determine the most cost-effective option for your group.

FAQ
Quick answers to common questions
Groups
Meetings
Are group fares cheaper?
Yes and no. On the surface, sometimes group fares appear more expensive that published rates. This is due to the flexible terms on group contracts. But it is more complicated than meets the eye.
Can I change names on a group contract?
Yes. You can change names up until 72 hours prior to departure on group contracts.
Can I hold all the seats on the plane?
Most airlines will only sell 50-60% of the main cabin to groups. Southwest and JetBlue will allow your group to take all the space on the plane. Chartering allows you to buy out the plane but is different than buying group space.
Do all airlines offer group contracts?
Most airlines offer group contracts, but not all.
How does group airfare get priced?
Airlines price main cabin seats at the lowest fare class. Once that fare class is exhausted, the next highest fare class will be booked. The final fare is then averaged and a slight discount is applied.
What are the benefits of group fares?
Group contracts allow you to lock in a price for more than 10 people while giving the flexibility to delay payments and cancel if needed.
When do my seats get assigned with group contracts?
Your seats get assigned when your group submits final payment and receives their tickets. This usually happens between 30-45 days prior to travel.
Why is there a booking fee?
In the past, group customers would hold space across multiple airlines with little intention that the group actually materializes. On the airline's side, the booking fee is designed to reduce cancellations.
Can I set up travel policy to help save money and control the budget?
Yes. During your onboarding call, your account manager will ask about what parameters you wish to enforce. Typically, companies set up a bunch of conditions that require the traveler to seek approval from a manager.
Can travelers upgrade and pay the difference?
Yes! We offer travelers the ability to upgrade and pay the difference. For example, say the main cabin price is $500, but the traveler wants to upgrade to first class. We can bill the company the main cabin fare and then the traveler the difference.
Can travelers upgrade with miles?
We recommend they do so inside of the airline's app. Third party travel agencies do not have the ability to transact with airline miles.
Can you book international?
Yes. We book travelers from around the world regularly.
Do you have 24/7 support?
Yes. Our team prides itself on our commitment to service, meaning we offer live-agent 24/7 service.
How do you save companies money on airfare?
If permitted, we set up contracts with each airline which typically give between 2-10% off published rates. We also have features like free refundability and name changes that typically save clients thousands each trip.
How much do you charge?
When traveling on a group contract, we do not have any ticketing fees. When traveling on an individual ticket, we charge a small fee per ticket.
How should people cancel or change their tickets?
Should a traveler want to cancel their ticket or make a change to their trip, they should contact us directly at travelops@allfly.io. If they need immediate assistance, please call us directly.
Is there a minimum group size to use AllFly Meetings?
No. While there is more savings and efficiency with larger groups, we often do small trips as well.
What is the process to get started?
After we conduct a short demo, we will send over a Services Agreement to review. Should you want to use AllFly, we will send over a deposit invoice. We will ask for a list of approved travelers, so they can be loaded into the sytem.
Who do you work with?
We work with meeting planners and companies who are booking travel for meetings, incentives, and team offsites. Currently, we only work with companies who are sponsoring the attendees travel.
Will I get an arrival and departures list for my trip?
Yes. We have a fantastic reporting suite that gives you total insight into your travel program.
FAQS
Frequently Asked Question
Can I book travel for a guest?
Yes, you can book guest travel with AllFly Quest. Payment terms depend on your company's travel policies.
Can I upgrade with miles after the ticket has been purchased on Quest?
Typically yes, although it depends on the airline s specific capabilities. We recommend you do so directly with the airline after your ticket has been issued. Third party travel agencies do not have the ability to transact with airline miles.
Do I get airline miles/points when booking with AllFly?
Yes! You can add your loyalty accounts in the profile section or during checkout. Those loyalty numbers are added to each of your reservations to ensure you receive any travel credits (points or miles) awarded by your favorite brands.
Does my company earn points when employees travel?
In many cases, yes. During the first week of creating your Quest account, please pass along any corporate airline accounts you may have. In addition, should you want help setting up corporate airline accounts, please let us know.
How do I cancel my flight?
Should a traveler want to cancel their ticket or make a change to their trip, they should contact us directly at travelops@allfly.io. If they need immediate assistance, please call us directly.
My company will pay for main cabin/economy fares, but I want to upgrade to first class, how do I do so?
During shopping, you can select the higher cabin class. We will bill the company for the main cabin fare, and bill the traveler the difference. For example, say the main cabin fare is $400, but the first class ticket is $1,200. At checkout, you will be notified you will pay the difference between the fares, which in this case is $800 plus any associated fees.

Yes. Service is at the heart of what we do. We offer 24/7 agent support in case of cancellations or flight disruptions.

How does AllFly work?
Watch Video
AllFly books air travel for meetings and events in three ways:
Online - we deploy an online booking tool called AllFly Quest
White glove - companies provide us a list of attendees and our agent team reaches out to book travel
What types of meetings does AllFly book?
Watch Video
AllFly books air travel for meetings in which the company or a single payer is sponsoring travel. Typically, these are incentive trips, corporate meetings, and team offsites.
What does AllFly do for associations or city-wides?
Typically, we don t book travel for associations, city-wides, or trips where the individual is responsible for paying for their own travel. We do however offer to set up discount codes with the airlines for the client to share with their partners.
How do we benefit clients?
Clients save both time and money when booking with AllFly. On average, we see companies save up to 15% on air travel when using our services. We drive these savings in a combination of ways, including:
Discounted rates
Ticket protection program
Booking everyone in the smallest window possible (before fares rise)
Optimizing the booking/registration window
What is the process for getting started?
Usually the HPN planner will go through Payton, who will link all parties up via email. We like to start each relationship off with an online video meeting in which we learn about the client, explore what they need, and demo our services.
We invite planners to take part in as much as the process as they wish! Either way, our team will keep you in the loop.
Do you offer white glove service?
Yes. Service is at the heart of what we do. We offer 24/7 agent support in case of cancellations or flight disruptions.
We also pair each account with a dedicated sales manager and account manager, meaning you will have no problem getting on the phone with someone on our team.
What is the ticket protection program?
Read Blog
We offer cash back on cancelled tickets on United, Delta, and American(minus a $50 fee). If someone cancels a Delta ticket for $600, we will refund the company $550. This is a huge savings because typically, cancelled tickets go as an eCredit on the travelers account, meaning that money is lost to the company.
Can I see a demo of the booking engine?
Watch Video
Of course! Click

to watch how AllFly Quest works!
Do you book charters and private planes?
Yes! Simply reach out to your sales manager to get started with a quote.
Do you book group contracts with the airlines?
Yes! Group contracts are our bread and butter. You can make your group request directly with your sales manager.
Do you have a tool to help my client budget for air?
Watch Video
Yes! Forecast is the easiest way to help planners budget airfare.
 
Best part of all, its free to use. Click

When there someone has to cancel or change a ticket, how does that work?
In order to cancel or change a ticket, we recommend getting in touch with your account manager via phone or email.

Group Airfare Basics
Learn how booking group airfare differs

Group airfare pricing appears more expensive
Group airfare is often the average of the multiple fare classes required to support your entire group.

Most airlines provide a partial-full refund if trips are cancelled 90 days before travel.
Group airfare has multiple stages
Group trips progress through several stages, starting with the booking deposit, then moving to utilization, followed by collecting passenger information, and finally paying the final balance.
Different Airlines have different policies
Each airline has different fee requirements and time periods when payments and other items are due.
We ve booked groups on over 40+ airlines. Here are our most popular.

FAQ's
Quick answers to common questions.
How many people do you need to book as a group?
The number of people required to book airline tickets as a group contract typically varies depending on the airline, but the minimum is usually around 10 passengers.
How far in advance should I book a group flight?
The ideal booking window for a group contract flight depends on the airline's policy and your travel destination. Here's a general guide:
Domestic flights (US & Canada): Airlines typically allow bookings for group contracts within the US and Canada up to 240 days before departure.
International flights: Booking windows for international flights can be even longer. For instance, some airlines might allow booking for Europe up to 331 days in advance.
Why is group airfare more expensive than published airfare?
When using an Online Travel Agency (OTA) like Expedia, Orbitz, or Travelocity, your search is typically limited to 6-8 passengers, and you are shown the lowest published fare available for that group size. As seats are booked, the remaining passengers may be moved to higher fare classes. Group airfare is often priced at either the highest fare class that can accommodate your group size or a blended average of all fare classes between the lowest and highest.
Fly your group by booking group airfare 6-9 months before travel can result in lower total costs because you lock in the rate when it's at its lowest. If group members were to book individually over time, the total cost is likely to be higher as individuals wait to buy closer to the departure date when prices increase dramatically.
Can I cancel my trip?
Cancellation policies vary by airline. Typically, airlines allow you to cancel your group trip with a full refund of your deposit, less any applicable fees, 60-90 days before your trip's departure date. After the final payment, made 30-45 days before your initial travel date, payments are usually non-refundable, but the airline may offer a change of flight credit. Specific policies will be outlined in the review screens before you complete your group trip booking.
Are Deposits Refundable?
Airlines vary in their refund policies. Some airlines offer a full refund if the trip is canceled before the utilization date, while others may deduct processing fees. A few airlines, like Southwest, have a non-refundable policy. The utilization date is typically set 60-90 days before the first departing flight in your group itinerary and is the deadline to cancel your trip to receive refunds on your deposit. However, some airlines do not refund any portion of the deposit once the trip is booked. These policies are visible as you book your group trip.
Some of our travelers want to travel back separately, is this possible?
Many airlines permit deviations, allowing a subset of travelers to return on separate flights as long as most of the initial group returns on the same itinerary. Some airlines also allow a subset of travelers to depart separately but return on the same itinerary. Policies vary by airline. To explore these options, request a custom trip so one of our agents can assist in finding the best airlines to meet your needs
What is the reason for the booking fee?
Historically, group customers would reserve space across multiple airlines with minimal intention of the group actually traveling. Airlines implemented the booking fee to mitigate the impact of these frequent cancellations.
Can you fly my group if it's over 75 people, or is that too big?
Large groups are complex. We recommend working with an agent and filling out a custom trip request form

What is an RFP?
Think of it as a formal invitation for vendors to showcase their capabilities. It clearly outlines your company's travel needs and sets the stage for a competitive bidding process.
Why is an RFP Important?

An RFP ensures everyone's on the same page. You define your project scope, objectives, and requirements, so vendors understand exactly what you're looking for.
Setting Expectations:
A well-defined RFP sets clear expectations and deliverables upfront. This helps hold vendors accountable throughout the project.
Proactive Risk Management:
A detailed RFP can help identify potential risks and challenges early on. This allows you to develop mitigation strategies before they become problems.
Competition Breeds Excellence:
By inviting multiple proposals, you foster a competitive environment. This can lead to better quality solutions and more cost-effective options.
Objective Evaluation:
The RFP establishes clear criteria for evaluating proposals. This allows you to compare different vendors based on a consistent standard, not just a sales pitch.
Especially in today's world,
RFPs are crucial for large organizations navigating the post-pandemic travel landscape. They provide a baseline assessment, demonstrate due diligence, and help new travel managers gain valuable industry knowledge.

5 Holiday Gifts to Purchase for Frequent Travelers
Shopping for the frequent traveler in your life doesn't have to be stressful. Here are five easy gift ideas for your favorite jet setter.
Kenny Totten
Are you looking for the perfect gift for the frequent traveler in your life? Whether they are a seasoned jet-setter or a newbie to the world of travel, there are plenty of gift options that can help them make the most of their trips. Here are five holiday gifts to consider for the frequent traveler in your life:
A luggage scale: A luggage scale can be a useful tool for frequent travelers, as it allows them to accurately weigh their luggage before they head to the airport. This can help them avoid paying excess baggage fees or having to repack at the last minute.
A travel adapter: A travel adapter is an essential item for any traveler, as it allows them to use their electronic devices in countries with different electrical outlets. There are many different types of travel adapters available, so you can choose one that is compatible with the destinations your loved one is most likely to visit.
A portable charger: A portable charger can be a lifesaver for travelers, as it allows them to keep their devices charged while on the go. Look for a charger with a high capacity and multiple charging ports to ensure that your loved one has enough power for all of their devices.
A travel pillow: A travel pillow can help make long flights or road trips more comfortable for your loved one. Look for a pillow that is lightweight and easy to pack, and consider one with a memory foam or other supportive material for added comfort.
A travel insurance policy: Travel insurance can provide peace of mind for frequent travelers, as it covers unexpected expenses and delays that may arise during a trip. Look for a policy that offers a wide range of coverage options, including trip cancellation, lost luggage, and medical coverage.
These are just a few gift ideas for the frequent traveler in your life. Whatever you choose, make sure to consider their specific travel needs and preferences, and look for gifts that will make their trips easier, more comfortable, and more enjoyable.

Corporate Travel: 3 Cons of Group Bookings
Choose AllFly Quest for flexible, cost-saving group air travel. Avoid red flags like no seat assignments, online check-in issues, and booking restrictions.
Molly Lombardo
When it comes to arranging corporate air travel, many companies opt for group contracts to streamline the process and potentially save costs. However, there are several red flags to consider before committing to a group booking.
Here are three key points to keep in mind:
No Seat Assignments Until Ticketing
: One major drawback of group contracts is the inability to assign seats until tickets are issued. This can be problematic, especially if you have specific seating requirements or need your team to sit together for a meeting or event.
Cannot Check In Online
: Another limitation of group bookings is the inability to check in online. This can be inconvenient, as it means your team will need to check in at the airport, potentially leading to longer wait times and added stress, especially during busy travel periods.
Cannot Modify the Booking or Upgrade:
Group contracts often come with strict terms and conditions regarding changes or upgrades. This lack of flexibility can be problematic if your travel plans change or if you want to upgrade seats for your team. Without the ability to modify the booking, you may be stuck with seats that no longer meet your needs.
Alternatives to Group Bookings
While group contracts offer certain advantages, such as guaranteed seats together, there are alternative options to consider:
AllFly Quest: Booking flights for each traveler separately allows for greater flexibility, as each person can manage their own booking. However, there's no guarantee that everyone will be on the same flight, which could be a drawback if travel coordination is essential.
Tips for Booking Corporate Travel
When deciding whether to book your corporate air travel with a group contract, consider the following tips:
Compare Prices
: Before committing to a group booking, compare prices to see if it actually saves money compared to booking individual flights. Sometimes, airlines may charge more for group bookings, as they are guaranteeing a block of seats.
Consider Flexibility Needs:
If you anticipate the need to change flights or upgrade seats, a group booking may not be the best option. Assess your flexibility needs before making a decision.
Plan in Advance:
Regardless of whether you choose to book a group or individual flights, planning in advance can help you secure better deals. The earlier you book, the better chance you have of getting good deals and securing seats together for your team.
In conclusion, while group contracts offer certain benefits, they also come with limitations that may not suit every corporate travel need.
Consider the red flags mentioned above and weigh them against the benefits to determine the best approach for your company's air travel needs.
Whether you decide on individual or group airfare, AllFly can be your trusted partner to help you make the best decision.
Our team of experts can help you navigate the complexities of corporate travel and find the best rates for your needs.

Spedlins Castle
$1480/night
Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, UK
See property
Ever wanna stay in a real castle? This magical tower, rising some 48ft above the countryside, this unique home is just as incredible inside as it looks. Its 9ft thick stone walls have stood the test of time since 1450. Exploring the castle for the first time is a wonderful experience, with a wealth of turrets, nooks and staircases to discover. The showstopper here is the Great Hall, with a high, arching ceiling and a Renaissance fireplace so huge you could walk inside it. There's a large kitchen, a dining room with seating for 14. On the floor above are 4 bedrooms - 3 doubles, 1 twin and a bathroom. On the 4th floor is another double bedroom, plus a dormitory room with 4 single beds and a 3rd bathroom. The grounds extend to 4 acres and include beautiful gardens and a lake.
 
 
Beautifully Restored Pullman Car

Alright, we couldn t resist adding this one  not just because it s a refurbished train, but also because it can hold up to 16 guests! This is a real 1925 Pullman Railroad Car, officially known as theTimes Square. It sits on railroad tracks next to the Dennison Railroad Depot Museum, which is a National Historic Landmark. There is easy access with a parallel street for parking, sidewalk and steps up into the car. All the original hardware, woodwork and lighting fixtures, have been restored, complete with artifacts and artwork, and some more modern amenities. Each Compartment has a center laminate table, WIFI, a 32 inch TV, private hand sink, and movable ladders. Kind of a neat and unique place to take your team if you want a little bit of  wow  factor.

The title of this BNB might sound lofty, but rightfully so! It s described as  upscale everything  and consists of 18 beds in 9 bedrooms in this massive French style country estate. We gotta talk amenities: They ve got a pool (heated upon request) and hot tub, outdoor gardens, a huge Theatre, a gym with high end equipment and even a True Golf Simulator. Even more unique is the unmatched concierge services, where Kaitlin can arrange outings (tours/ roof top bars, Vineyard/Winery, etc.), a chef to come in to prepare meals, an acoustic concert, flower arrangements or whatever you can imagine that would make your trip over the top delightful. Pretty impressive place for a team offsite.

AllFly FAQ
Unleash the Power of Flight Cost Estimation
How far in the future can I estimate a flight?
Airlines typically update their schedules 330 days in advance. However, with our forecasting tool, you can estimate flight details beyond that threshold. Keep in mind that the further out you estimate, the less accurate the information may be.
What is a flight cost estimator?
A flight cost estimator is a tool that helps you predict the potential cost of airfare for your trip. It considers factors like travel dates, routes, cabin class, and historical data to provide a more accurate estimate than simply looking at current fares.
How can AllFly's flight cost calculator help my business?
AllFly's flight cost calculator, also known as Forecast, is a powerful tool for businesses of all sizes. It helps travel managers:
Optimize travel budgets:
Get a clear picture of potential airfare costs before booking. Simplify travel planning: Streamline the process of finding cost-effective flights for teams.

What if I need a more detailed flight cost analysis?

5 Overlooked Corporate Group Travel Locations Due to High Airfares
Strategic corporate travel planning unlocks hidden gems, creating memorable and productive offsites for teams.
Lizzy Czyz
It's common for major cities like New York and Los Angeles to be the go-to choice for corporate events, but there are plenty of hidden gems throughout the United States waiting to be discovered. Unfortunately, high flight prices often make these locations less desirable for corporate travel. In this blog, we'll cover five amazing places that corporations may have overlooked due to their higher airfare costs.
San Diego, California:
Beautiful beaches, world-famous attractions like the San Diego Zoo, and a laid-back coastal vibe make San Diego a perfect offsite destination. Ideal for team-building activities, outdoor adventures, and exploring the Pacific Coast.
The historic
Gaslamp Quarter
is a must-visit destination, filled with Victorian-style buildings, bars, and quirky shops. Your team can opt for a walking tour to learn all the ins and outs of the Gaslamp's vibrant past, or simply take a stroll around and immerse themselves in the atmosphere. There are countless opportunities for team bonding, whether it's enjoying a pub crawl or a group dinner at one of the many delectable restaurants.
Explore the world-renowned
San Diego Zoo
and get up close and personal with some of the most iconic creatures, such as pandas, giraffes, and lions. Take a tram tour through the expansive park, or watch playful dolphins and sea lions perform. The zoo also offers educational exhibits and shows, offering a perfect blend of fun and learning.
 
Lake Tahoe, California/Nevada:
This alpine gem offers stunning lake views, world-class skiing and snowboarding in winter, and hiking, biking, and watersports in summer. Casinos, nightlife, and luxury accommodations add to the appeal.
Lake Tahoe is home to some of the world's leading ski resorts, including
Heavenly Mountain Resort
and
Northstar California Resort
, which cater to skiers of all levels. Try skiing, snowboarding, or tubing down snow-capped mountains while taking in the stunning views of the crystal-clear lake. After a day of thrills, gather around a roaring fireplace in a cozy lodge for hot chocolate and team building.
Put your teamwork and problem-solving skills to the test at one of Lake Tahoe's many
rock climbing spots
. Beginners can try indoor walls, while experienced climbers can tackle challenging routes with stunning lake views. This adrenaline-pumping activity promotes trust and communication as you help each other reach new heights.
Jackson Hole, Wyoming:
 
A true skier's paradise, Jackson Hole also boasts Yellowstone National Park's incredible geysers and wildlife. Dude ranch experiences, horseback riding, and scenic gondola rides add to the charm.
Venture into the must-visit
Yellowstone National Park
, just a short drive from Jackson Hole. You'll find a breathtaking world of geysers erupting, colorful hot springs bubbling, and mud pots gurgling. Don't miss out on iconic landmarks like Old Faithful and the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone!
Embrace the spirit of the Wild West with authentic Jackson Hole experiences. Go
horseback riding
through scenic trails, fly fishing in clear rivers, or whitewater rafting on the rapids of the Snake River. Square dancing adds to the immersive experience!
Asheville, North Carolina:
Stunning Blue Ridge Mountains, a vibrant arts scene, delicious Appalachian cuisine, and a booming craft brewery scene. Ideal for outdoor retreats, team-building activities, and cultural immersion.
Check out Asheville's thriving art scene in the
River Arts District
. Explore over 200 studios housed in former warehouses, admire colorful murals adorning the buildings, and watch artists at work. Browse unique galleries, find handcrafted souvenirs, and soak up the creative energy of this vibrant district.
Asheville is a haven for beer lovers, boasting over 50 breweries within city limits. Take a
brewery tour
to learn about the brewing process, sample diverse beers, and discover your new favorite pint. Enjoy rooftop brewery bars with stunning mountain views, or cozy brewpubs with live music and friendly vibes.
Savannah, Georgia:
 
Savannah's cobblestone streets, historic architecture, and Southern charm create an inviting atmosphere for corporate events. Stroll past moss-draped mansions, uncover Civil War secrets, and bond with colleagues over haunted pub crawls or riverfront kayak adventures. Savannah's walkable historic district offers diverse activities, from museums and live theater to cooking classes and rooftop soirees, all with budget-friendly options and modern amenities
Take a cooking class
and learn the secrets behind classic dishes such as shrimp and grits or pecan pie. This fun and interactive class is an excellent way to break the ice while enjoying Savannah's rich culinary heritage. Discover the flavors of the South and bond with your coworkers as you prepare delicious meals together.
Step into Savannah's spooky side with a thrilling
haunted pub crawl
. Embark on a guided tour through the city's historic streets, stopping at haunted pubs and hearing chilling tales of ghosts and ghouls. Sip on themed cocktails, test your courage, and bond with your team over scary encounters.
As businesses look for fresh and inspiring locations for corporate meetings and team offsites, it's crucial to look beyond the conventional choices. These five US destinations, though often overlooked due to high flight prices, have unique offerings that can enhance your corporate travel experience. By strategically planning corporate travel and considering alternative options, companies can unlock the potential of these hidden gems, creating memorable and productive offsites for their teams.

8 Best Business Travel Management Apps
Top 8 group booking platforms! AllFly shines with ease of use, prices & service
Lizzy Czyz
In the dynamic landscape of corporate travel, finding the right platform to manage group airfare for meetings and events is crucial for a seamless and cost-effective experience. In this article, we explore the top 8 most popular booking platforms for group contracts. Among these, AllFly stands out as a leading choice for its simplicity, competitive pricing, top notch customer service, and user-friendly interface.
1. AllFly:
 
Why AllFly?
AllFly takes the spotlight as the go-to platform for group airfare. With a commitment to simplicity, AllFly offers a seamless experience for managing group flights. Its user-friendly interface, dedicated customer service, and competitive pricing make it an excellent choice for businesses of all sizes.

Considerations
: While AllFly may lack some advanced features, its emphasis on efficiency, experience, and affordability makes it stand out as the top choice.
2. AmTrav:
 
Why AmTrav?
AmTrav provides customizable solutions for corporate travel with integrated expense management. AmTrav caters to the specific needs of organizations seeking a comprehensive solution.
 
Considerations
: AmTrav has a monthly membership that would cost you hundreds per month, even if you don t have any trips planned!
3. Concur Travel:
 
Why Concur?
Concur stands out for its comprehensive travel and expense management capabilities. Concur offers a one-stop solution for businesses with complex travel needs including expense management.
 
Considerations:
Concur's feature-rich platform may be too much for businesses with simpler travel requirements and their platform isn t very user-friendly.
4. Egencia:
 
Why Egencia?
Powered by Amex GBT, Egencia provides a comprehensive platform for managing group airfare contracts. With a user-friendly interface and travel policy enforcement tools, Egencia caters to businesses seeking a holistic travel management solution.
 
Considerations:
Some users report higher costs and inconsistencies in customer support.
5. FCM:
 
Why FCM
? FCM is a leading global travel management company, offering dedicated services for business travel. With a global presence and specialized solutions, FCM caters to the needs of businesses who are looking to book airfare for meetings and events.
 
Considerations
: While FCM provides comprehensive services, pricing may be relatively high.
6. Groupize:
 
Why Groupize?
Groupize focuses on specialized group bookings and centralized management for flights and accommodations. With a commitment to simplifying the group travel experience, Groupize stands out for its user-friendly approach.
 
Considerations

7. Navan:
 
Why Navan?
Navan focuses on optimizing corporate travel, offering features for travel policy compliance, cost control, and reporting. Providing
customizable solutions for businesses of various sizes.
 
Considerations:

TravelPerk provides a comprehensive business travel platform covering flights, hotels, and more. Its centralized management tools make it an all-encompassing solution for businesses.

AllFly Enhances Collaboration with Your In-House Air Team
Elevate your corporate travel strategy with AllFly   the top choice for incentive houses and companies with internal travel teams.
Conner Ann Waterman
Incentive houses and companies with internal travel teams frequently choose Quest to fulfill their requirements. Picture Quest as a tool similar to Microsoft Excel.
Just as we use Excel spreadsheets daily to streamline work processes, why not leverage Quest internally to optimize the travel functions of internal teams? The tool provides travel teams with accessible features, making their work more efficient and convenient.
Historically, travel platforms have been perceived as competitors to internal travel teams. However, Quest takes a different approach; we don't aim to compete with your internal team. Instead, our goal is to simplify your life by seamlessly integrating with your company's structure
Partnering with your In-house team
AllFly can collaborate with internal teams during periods of high demand, providing "pressure relief" by handling excess trips that may overwhelm the in-house resources
This enables your internal air team to concentrate on their primary trips or core duties, thereby minimizing their workload and stress. Delegating these specialized trips to AllFly ensures that your team can sustain their dedication to delivering outstanding service to your clients.
Facilitating guest booking
Planning incentive trips can be a logistical puzzle, especially when coordinating the travel arrangements for a diverse group of company employees and guests.
AllFly offers a seamless solution with its user-friendly self-service booking tool. This tool empowers event attendees to take control of their travel plans, offering the flexibility and convenience that every traveler craves.
By entrusting attendees with the ability to manage their own arrangements, not only does this lighten the workload for your travel management team, but it also elevates the travel experience for your guests, making it more enjoyable and stress-free.
 
Boosted Transparency through Real-Time Reporting
Access real-time insights into your travelers' reservations through AllFly's extensive reporting features. Keep track of arrival and departure lists, total cost summaries, and other crucial data to stay informed about the status of your event.
Our reporting is dynamically updated to reflect changes, delays, or cancellations in travelers' reservations as they occur.
Cash Back on canceled tickets
AllFly offers a unique and significant advantage that holds special importance for us   our
Ticket Protection Program.
When travelers book with Delta, American, or United airlines under a master bill, we have the capability to secure cash back for canceled tickets, returning that value to your company. Ordinarily, canceled fares result in an eCredit on the traveler's profile, and the company loses access to that money. This can be a substantial benefit, especially when dealing with larger groups of travelers.
AllFly Forecast: Your New Best Friend
AllFly provides a complimentary program named Forecast, enabling in-house teams to quickly estimate airfare budgets and compare different destinations.
 
 
Leveraging AllFly s Expertise for Your Specific Needs
Integrate AllFly into your travel management system to streamline operations, ease the workload on your internal team, elevate the travel experience for clients, and access exclusive AllFly perks. It's the ideal addition to your corporate travel strategy, ensuring meticulous management of your meetings and events.

AllFly Raises $2.4 Million to Revolutionize Group and Event Travel
We are excited to have the backing of two Chicago based VC funds, Lightbank and Corazon Capital.
Kenny Totten
We are proud to announce we've raised our first round of venture capital from two great firms out of Chicago.
We've secured $2.4 million in funding, led by Lightbank with participation from Corazon Capital. Bill Pescatello of Lightbank will join our board with Nina Essandoh joining as a board observer. We are beyond lucky to have both Bill and Nina join the AllFly team.
Moments like this are important to stop and reflect on progress.
AllFly's origin story can trace its way back to 2014, when CEO Eric Peterson began booking group contracts for other tour operators. What was true in 2014, is sadly still true today.
Far too much of group travel happens offline.
Planning and executing group travel is still terribly inefficient, complex, and often confusing.
Our goal from the very beginning has always been to make group travel easy and online.
The team at AllFly has made great strides in simplifying and streamlining the group and event travel space. We started off fairly narrow in focus and scope. For years, we zeroed in on booking airfare for mainly student groups. Over the last 3 years, we expanded our horizons as our customers asked for more capabilities and functionality.
We now proudly offer a suite of products designed to help tour operators, meeting planners, and businesses plan, book, and manage group travel. Essentially, whoever and however your organization decides to travel, we have a solution for you:
AllFly Marketplace- shop, book, and manage group air contracts online (10+ tickets)
AllFly Meetings- easily book airfare for your next corporate team meeting or offsite (individual tickets)
Forecast- quickly estimate airfare for your next corporate meeting
The funds will be used to expand AllFly's product offerings in the corporate meetings and events space with an exciting slate of feature updates to drop this summer. We also plan on investing in AllFly Marketplace, as group travel is still core to our success.
New AllFly board member, Bill Pescatello of Lightbank, is bullish on backing the AllFly team.  At Lightbank, our focus is on identifying companies that have the potential to transform large underserved markets, and AllyFly is a great example. With its innovative approach, AllyFly has quickly become a go-to choice for group travel and corporate partners in this vast ecosystem. 
The corporate travel market presents an exciting opportunity, as COVID-19 has changed the way teams meet and work. AllFly has seen a significant uptick in corporate customer sign-ups during the first three months of 2023. We've seen great success partnering with meeting planners who's clients are in need of an air solution.
Partnering with meeting planners and event companies has been an important part of our growth story and will continue to be on the forefront of how we bring value to the group & event travel market.
On the groups side of the business, its been nice to see student travel finally bounce back. While its not at 2019 levels yet, its trending in that direction.
Our tour operator partners have been resilient in face of adversity. Many of the tour operators who survived COVID are coming back stronger than ever, and we can't wait to help support them in their bounce-back stories.
Stay tuned for some exciting announcements as the best is yet to come.

7 Reasons Concur Customers use AllFly for Meeting & Event Travel
Concur customers love using AllFly for group, meeting, and incentive travel.
Kenny Totten
Are you
still
using Concur for your meeting travel?
If so, bless your heart.
Concur was created back in 1993 when flip phones were cool and Microsoft Word was considered a cutting edge piece of software. While the world of software (including Word) has come leaps and bounds, Concur has stayed frozen in time.
And news flash, it's costing your company money.
Over the last several years, we ve had scores of customers using AllFly to book their corporate group, meeting, and incentive travel. Truth is, Concur is serviceable for every day business travel and expense.
If Joe Buck is going on a three day trip to New York   sure, have him book on Concur.
But if your entire company is doing a big offsite in Cancun, you may want to think twice about using just any old online booking tool.
We began building the first version of AllFly Quest in 2021. We realized that COVID forever changed how teams travel, and that online travel booking platforms needed to have specific features and structure built around the concept of events and big company wide get-togethers.
Here are the top 7 reasons why Concur customers pick AllFly to book their event and meeting travel.
Book guest travel with ease
Concur famously only lets you book travel for one passenger. This is a huge problem for the way modern passengers travel. Incentive trips often allow travelers to bring a guest. AllFly Quest allows you to book up to six people on the same record, making upgrades and flight disruptions a breeze.
We load in discounted fares using meeting contracts
AllFly Quest offers special discounted fares called meeting contracts, saving you money without any effort on your part. Off the shelf, Concur sticks to publicly available fares from Sabre, leaving you and your company to pay full price.
AllFly gives companies cash back on canceled tickets
AllFly Quest's Ticket Protection Program gives you cash back on canceled tickets, so you don't lose the value of the ticket like you would with Concur's non-transferable eCredits.
User-friendly shopping experience
Log into Concur and instantly be overwhelmed and confused by all the buttons and clunky user interface. AllFly Quest's modern, clean interface makes shopping for travel a breeze, while Concur's outdated interface is a productivity killer. The longer your people have to suffer through bad UI/UX, the less productive they are for your core business.
Event level travel policy enforcement
AllFly Quest has the unique feature of allowing companies to create an  event.  Legacy booking platforms simply have one global policy which typically lacks the controls needed for events. For example, inside of AllFly, you can set rules around when attendees need to arrive and depart for specific events. You can also set rules around how many days can attendees come early, or extend their trip. Legacy booking tools were built around a single employee, traveling as an individual, not as a team.
No reimbursement nightmare
AllFly s streamlined billing process will make your finance department smile! Rather than allow every traveler to buy their own flight and submit for reimbursement, AllFly bills the company a deposit, and then submits the final balance at the conclusion of booking   meaning your company pays two invoices, rather than dozens or possibly hundreds!
Save money with group contracts (10+ people, flying together)
With AllFly, you can secure group contracts for meeting travel, saving you money and giving you better terms. Concur only lets you book single tickets, but with AllFly Quest, you can hold space with a deposit, pay in full 30 days prior to travel, and switch names on tickets up until 72 hours before departure. Group contracts for corporate meeting travel are best secured 100+ days prior to departure.
If you have an upcoming meeting or event that you need to book airfare for   we should talk.
We aren t saying you need to dump Concur and replace all things travel with AllFly.
But we are saying that tons of clients use AllFly in addition to Concur, specifically for team offsites, incentive trips, and meetings.

AllFly Quest vs. Egencia
AllFly Quest is revolutionizing corporate travel with its innovative features.
Grace Brooke
For years, business travelers have relied on Egencia to manage their corporate travel needs. However, a new challenger has emerged: AllFly Quest.
This innovative platform boasts a suite of features designed to surpass Egencia in several key areas, making corporate travel smoother, more efficient, and more rewarding.
Revolutionizing Booking Flexibility
AllFly introduces a game-changing split payment service, a feature absent in Egencia. Egencia's limitations restrict bookings to one guest per transaction, causing complications for travelers with companions.
This innovative split payment allows booking airfare for both the traveler and a guest, with each using their preferred payment method.
Travelers can even leverage this flexibility for ticket upgrades, effortlessly splitting the cost difference   a level of convenience Egencia simply doesn't offer.
Effortless Rewards Program
While Egencia offers a business rewards program, travelers must navigate the complexities of enrolling with each airline individually.
AllFly's streamlined rewards program eliminates this hassle.  It's user-friendly and saves valuable time, while still offering significant savings opportunities.
The Modern Platform for a Remote World
AllFly's Quest platform is a true game-changer for corporate travel in today's remote work environment.
Understanding the need for flexible team travel, Quest allows individuals to book group trips with team members departing from different locations.
This user-friendly platform, accessible on any device, offers advanced search functionalities, ensuring travelers can quickly find the most suitable flights.
AllFly's modern approach eliminates the lengthy and cumbersome processes that traditionally make corporate travel stressful.
Businesses can now focus on the core purpose   fostering essential team connections and learning experiences at their destinations.
AllFly Quest: The Future of Corporate Travel
AllFly Quest is redefining corporate travel with its seamless solutions and intuitive interface.
Split payment services, cash back protection, and a modern platform are just a few features that set AllFly apart.
AllFly Quest is setting a new standard for corporate travel, offering businesses and their employees a more efficient, rewarding, and enjoyable travel experience.

AllFly's Game-Changing Split Payment Feature
Split payments with AllFly allow corporate travelers to book airfare seamlessly for themselves and upgrade their seat or bring a guest on their own dime.
Lizzy Czyz
In the fast-paced world of corporate travel, flexibility and efficiency are paramount. AllFly, your trusted airfare management partner, has taken a step forward with its game-changing split payment feature.
Split payments with AllFly allow corporate travelers to book airfare seamlessly for themselves and upgrade their seat or bring a guest on their own dime. What makes AllFly truly exceptional is not only the innovation itself but also the fact that many of our competitors are yet to offer a comparable solution.
While Concur is a popular competitor of ours, it has yet to offer something close to AllFly s split payment feature for guests and upgrades. Concur only allows one traveler to book at a time and if they want to upgrade to first class, they have to do so post ticketing (if the airline even allows it).
Gone are the days of rigid corporate travel policies and tedious reimbursement processes. AllFly understands the evolving needs of modern businesses and their employees. The split payment feature is a testament to our commitment to providing a streamlined, user-friendly experience.
How Does AllFly's Split Payment Work?
 
Imagine this scenario: your employee is getting ready to book their flight to their company s corporate trip through AllFly where they re allowed to bring a guest at your own expense. With AllFly's split payment feature, they can now book both tickets at the same time and AllFly will simply allow the traveler to pay for their guest at checkout.
Split payments are also utilized for upgrades. Let s say your employee or traveler wants more leg room or to upgrade to first class but you as the company do not want to pay for their luxurious requests. AllFly will simply send them an invoice for their upgrade as well!
Ready to Elevate Your Corporate Travel Experience?
Are you ready to embrace a new era of corporate travel management? AllFly's split payment feature is designed to make your life easier, offering flexibility for both travelers and their organizations.
Say goodbye to rigid policies and hello to a future where travel management adapts to your needs. Our commitment to user satisfaction and seamless processes sets us apart in a market where others are yet to catch up.

AllFly vs. Concur
Upgrade your corporate travel management with AllFly Quest.
Conner Ann Waterman
It's no secret that Concur is a household name when it comes to corporate travel management. While Concur has served well for traditional business travel, it's time to consider a more modern and efficient solution, particularly for team offsites, incentive trips, and meetings.
 
Why Concur Isn t Cutting It for Event Travel
Since Concur was launched in 1993, its user interface and features have not evolved. Its clunky interface can be frustrating and time-consuming to navigate, and it lacks essential features for managing group travel in the 21st century.
Here are a few of the limitations of Concur for event travel:
Limited guest trave
l: Concur only allows booking for one passenger per reservation, making it difficult to manage group travel with guests
No discounted fares
: Concur depends on publicly accessible fares from Sabre, causing companies to overlook potential savings that could arise from group contracts
Non-transferable eCredits for canceled tickets
: With Concur, canceled tickets result in non-transferable eCredits, which can be a hassle to use
Outdated user interface
: The user interface of Concur is outdated and not conducive to user-friendliness, creating challenges for travelers to swiftly and efficiently book their trips.
Lack of event-level policy enforcement
: Concur s global policy lacks the granular controls needed for managing event-specific travel requirements
Reimbursement nightmare
: Concur's reimbursement process can be a daunting task for finance departments, involving the management of dozens or even hundreds of individual invoices.
Why AllFly Quest is the Ideal Solution
AllFly Quest, a modern travel management platform, is specifically designed to address the shortcomings of Concur for event travel.
Here are just a few of the benefits of using AllFly Quest:
Book guest travel with ease
: AllFly Quest allows booking for up to six passengers per reservation, making it easy to manage group travel with guests
Discounted fares through meeting contracts
: AllFly Quest offers special discounted fares called meeting contracts, saving companies money on group travel
User-friendly shopping experience
: AllFly Quest s modern and intuitive interface makes shopping for travel a breeze, saving time by cutting the booking process in half
Event-level travel policy enforcement
: With AllFly Quest, companies can create custom event policies with granular controls, ensuring compliance with specific travel requirements.
Streamlined billing process
: With AllFly Quest's streamlined billing process, finance departments can reduce administrative burdens.
Group contracts for 10+ travelers
: Group contracts with AllFly Quest can offer additional savings and flexibility for parties of 10 or more passengers
Don t Ditch Concur, Complement It with AllFly
We re not here to break up a happy marriage, we aren t saying you dump Concur and replace all things travel with AllFly.
Nevertheless, many companies already use AllFly Quest alongside Concur, taking advantage of a more modern and efficient approach to managing group travel.
Your event travel process can be streamlined and you can save money with AllFly Quest.

Are We A Good Fit?
Discover the ultimate corporate travel solution with AllFly, your one-stop-shop for efficient and streamlined travel management.
Molly Lombardo
If you landed here, chances are you are evaluating adopting a corporate travel platform for your company.
Enclosed is an honest guide on how you should evaluate your options. Whether your company's travel program is looking for solutions, currently managed, or somewhere in between, we are a one stop shop for you to reach all of your travel goals. There are a handful of travel platforms out there but let s go over why companies get the most value from AllFly.
AllFly works with companies that frequently travel for team meetings, incentive trips, and offsites. We ve created an easy to use online booking platform created specifically for the needs of business travelers and event organizers. AllFly provides a variety of powerful tools to help them manage their travel programs, including the ability to set travel policies, simultaneously book guest travel, and generate live reports.
With that being said, not every trip is a perfect fit. If your company is on the smaller side, fewer than 20 employees, you might not get the full benefits of AllFly's services. It's like having a sports car for short trips around the block. Another thing to mention, AllFly does not currently offer multi-currency or multi-language support at this time. The key is to think about what your company truly needs when it comes to travel management before going all-in with AllFly. You can always schedule a call with a sales representative to discuss whether your trip is a good fit for AllFly's services.
At AllFly, we know travel is particular. Everyone has their own travel styles and preferences. Travelers want the control of booking their flights themselves. This is why our online platform allows for the best user experience. They can hop into the booking engine and select in-policy flights in minutes that suit their individual needs.
 
Travel policies set at the event level
. At AllFly, we understand that each trip is different. So we made travel policies that reflect the concerns of travel coordinators everywhere. We work around programming, discuss travel budgets, and set price caps for approval ensuring all travelers are abiding by the same guidelines.
 
Booking guest travel couldn t get any simpler.
If your trip allows for plus ones and guest travel is a part of the experience, AllFly allows you to book up to six people on the same PNR. When selecting flights in the platform, you can book for your guest traveler simultaneously.
 
Live reporting at your fingertips
. You will have 24/7 access to your live reporting suite within the portal. This will include an air budget summary of your trip, arrival and departure lists, and ticket cost breakdowns by traveler. As delays, cancellations, and changes are happening, your report is updating in real time. Easy to download and share. Duty of care? Check.
 
Speaking of Duty of Care
. As a responsible employer, you have a duty of care to your traveling employees. In times of crisis, like natural disasters or geopolitical events, you need to know where your employees are and ensure their safety. Our system tracks every flight and employee, helping you meet your duty of care obligations.
 
Competitive fares
. Let's start with the elephant in the room: fares. It's essential to know that when you book through us, you won't get a cheaper fare than what you'd find elsewhere. Whether you compare us to Expedia, Amex, or any other competitor, the base fare is going to be the same. We operate on a level playing field with airlines, ensuring you get the best rates available.
 
Booking Efficiency
. Time is money, and that's where our booking efficiency comes into play. Our managed booking solution streamlines the process, helping your team book flights 50% faster. This means you can secure tickets before fares start climbing. Our system also nudges travelers who haven't booked yet, ensuring that opportunities for savings aren't missed.
 
24/7 Customer Service
. We take the customer experience very seriously here at AllFly. With our 24/7 phone support, availability to book support video calls, and flight help email, we can handle anything you need. Delays, cancellations, and flight changes are inevitable. Not to mention our built in flight monitoring software to ensure any changes get handled with urgency.
Now that I got the facts out of the way, the real value is in the efficiency and peace of mind that comes with having a trusted travel management partner by your side.
So, when it comes to booking airfare for your next business trip, consider the benefits AllFly has to offer. There are more than what s listed above so I can lure you into a demo to knock your socks off!
Still unsure if we re a good fit? That s okay, let's talk about it!

Arming the Rebels, How AllFly is Following in the Footsteps of Shopify
Third party meeting planners can compete with the bigger travel management companies by adopting AllFly Meetings.
Kenny Totten
Years ago, it felt like Amazon was going to complete its mission and become the everything store.
While you can buy almost anything on Amazon, the question lingered 
Just because you can buy
anything
on Amazon, should you buy
everything
on Amazon.
See, the problem with world-beating companies is that they create monopolies. And because of shareholder pressure, the folks at Amazon are under constant pressure to grow revenue and margins.
This often comes at a price.
When a company starts doing well on Amazon, suddenly and magically, an  Amazon Basics  brand pops up to compete. This famously happened with the shoe company, Allbirds.
Allbirds is a popular shoe company and who was flying high.
(Excuse the bird pun)
Amazon ripped off the design and copied them by creating an Amazon Basics version of the shoe popular in startup culture. The CEO of Allbirds famously trolled Amazon on Twitter  you can
read about the saga
.
Large incumbents like Amazon often make it harder for smaller, mission focused companies to compete. That is, until someone comes along and equalizes the playing field. For independent retailers, your choices were to sell on Amazon (which Amazon takes a cut of and if you manage to become too successful, Amazon than copies your product) or build your own e-commerce shopping platform.
Most brands don t have the technical expertise to build and manage their own online store. In 2004, Shopify CEO Tobias Lutke saw this and built Shopify, an easy way to build your own online store.
This gives smaller, independent retailers the chance to compete with the global behemoths, like Amazon.
We draw inspiration from this story and are arming 3rd party meeting planners the tools to compete with the large travel agencies for meetings and events.
Big travel management companies (TMCs)  like TripActions have all the online tools to manage travel. You can book flights, hotels, and car rentals on the platform. However, the large TMCs like TripActions also have a division to book meetings and events 
There are over
135,000 meeting
, convention, and incentive planners in the United States. Many of them are independent contractors who organize, book, and manage meetings on behalf of companies.
Often, these smaller meeting planners don t have all the technology some of their larger competitors do.
For example, let s say Cheryl is a 3rd party meeting planner booking a restaurant group s annual meeting to Las Vegas. The restaurant group is going to fly in 250 people for the meeting. Cheryl is not TripActions and doesn t have all of the technology needed to book and manage the flights.
But Cheryl can t partner with the large TMC, because the large TMC has their own meetings division and can potentially snake her business down the road.
We saw this as an opportunity. Cheryl uses a lot of tools and vendors to go up against the large TMCs.
The tech industry sees Shopify as  arming the rebels  to fight against the likes of Amazon.
In travel, we are arming 3rd party meeting planners to go against the big TMCs like CWT, BCD, AMEX, and TripActions.
With AllFly Meetings, 3rd party planners can offer their clients the ability to book and manage airfare in an easy to set up, lightweight booking software, all backed by our amazing service team.
We offer all the technical trappings the legacy players do, with some awesome wrinkles built specifically for the modern meeting.
Best of all, we stay in our lane and are focused on partnering with meeting planners to give them superpowers, while ensuring their clients have an easy to use and responsive travel management platform at their fingertips.

Best Practices for Handling Southwest Release Days
Southwest Airlines is unique in the sense that it limits how far in advance its customers can shop for airfare.
Kenny Totten
Southwest Airlines is unique in the sense that it limits how far in advance its customers can shop for airfare. When they open their schedules, every travel agency in America is competing for space.
Southwest has a long history of doing things differently.
While most of the airline world releases their schedules 330 days in advance of travel, Southwest famously holds back their inventory and releases it several days a year.
For groups of 10 or more passengers, looking to book group contracts on Southwest, this causes a frenzy on  Southwest Release Days. 
On the morning that Southwest releases its schedules, travel agencies from around the world hit the phone lines at 7:00am eastern time in order to grab space. Here is a quick guide to navigating Southwest release days.
Hold space on another carrier, because you might not get Southwest space
Southwest is a favorite with groups because of their baggage policies along with flexible seating. Having a backup group block on another carrier is advised. Other carriers, like American and United are charging booking fees to hold space and these fees on non-refundable in the case of a cancellation, but its best to run the risk of losing $100 rather than not getting the space you need.
Go through a travel agency
Don t sit on the phone with Southwest yourself. Go through a travel agency who is used to calling and navigating the craziness of release days
Bulk request fares
If you have multiple contracts that you want priced, be sure to do them all at once. The space is competitive and the agents will sit on hold with you and price contracts as long as you want. Best to get organized   if you have 3 groups to request, do all three at once.

Corporate Takeover: The 2026 World Cup
2026 World Cup twist! Big business buys tickets, turns games into corporate offsites
Molly Lombardo
Recent reports from the IPW travel trade show in Los Angeles shed light on a major shift in the dynamics of the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup. Traditionally a global celebration for soccer fans, the event is increasingly becoming a corporate offsite, with big businesses driving much of the ticket sales.
Oswaldo Freitas, CEO of Easy Time Travel, noted that the World Cup has transformed into a corporate event, stating,  It s not a public event anymore.  Lena Ross, COO of America 4 You and chairwoman of the International Inbound Travel Association, echoed this sentiment, highlighting that big corporations are purchasing ticket blocks to distribute to their clients and customers.
The rising cost of FIFA tournaments has made it difficult for individual travelers to afford attendance. Freitas pointed out,  Because of the rate, the cost of the hospitality [package] tickets is so high that a regular customer cannot afford that. 
As a result, the bulk of business for tour operators is expected to come from corporations rewarding high-performing employees, with tickets going on sale in 2025.
While this trend benefits tour operators specialized in corporate groups, those focusing on individual travelers may face financial pressure.
The World Cup's impact can also lead to price increases from local partners, as seen in Paris in preparation for the 2024 Olympics.
The upcoming World Cup will span nearly 40 days across 11 U.S. cities, potentially affecting tourism in those areas.
Ross expressed concern about placing normal clients in cities with high World Cup interest. Nick Hentschel, COO of AmericanTours International, highlighted in a recent Skift article the importance of hoteliers being mindful of other types of travelers, not just World Cup attendees.
As the 2026 World Cup approaches, the spotlight is shifting towards corporate interests, potentially leaving regular fans on the sidelines. While this presents challenges for individual travelers, corporate travel specialists stand to benefit, offering exclusive experiences for companies.
However, destinations hosting World Cup games may experience a surge in visitors, leading to concerns about hotel pricing and the impact on non-World Cup tourists.
The evolving landscape of the World Cup underscores the changing dynamics of global events and their impact on both tourism and corporate travel.

Best Practices for Booking Event Travel
Follow these best practices to streamline your event travel experience, ensuring a smooth journey from booking to arrival.
Kenny Totten
Traveling for events can be exciting, but navigating the booking process can feel overwhelming. This guide offers valuable tips to ensure a smooth and efficient experience.
Profile Perfection:
Before diving into travel options, ensure your profile on the booking platform is complete and up-to-date. Double-check that your name matches exactly how it appears on your government-issued ID.
Pro Tip Checklist:
Accurate Name: Ensure your name matches your ID precisely.
Speedy Security: Add TSA Precheck or Global Entry information (no one enjoys long lines!)
Loyalty Advantage: Include any airline, hotel, or car rental loyalty program numbers.
Mobile Marvels: Download frequently used airline, hotel, and car rental apps. These offer convenience and flexibility, especially if unexpected situations arise while traveling.
Timing is Key:
Booking flights and hotels is a dynamic process. Prices and availability constantly fluctuate, so timing your purchases strategically is crucial.
Domestic Flights: Aim to book roughly 90 days before departure. This sweet spot offers a balance between lower fares and decent seat availability.
International Adventures: For longer journeys, plan further ahead. We recommend booking 120-150 days prior to your trip.
Flexibility is Golden: Be prepared to adjust your travel dates, especially during peak seasons or popular destinations. For instance, booking an early Miami trip during Spring Break might be necessary due to limited space.
Understanding Company Travel Policies:
While booking a luxurious first-class seat might be tempting, most companies establish travel policies to manage expenses.
Clear Communication (Admins): If you're an administrator, ensure your company's travel policies are communicated clearly and concisely.
Informed Travelers: Travelers should take the time to read and understand their company's travel policy guidelines.
Out-of-Policy Options: Platforms like Quest allow selecting flights, hotels, and cars that fall outside company policies. These requests require review by an administrator or travel manager before processing.
Changes and Cancellations:
Cancellations:  For cancellations, contacting a team member directly is recommended. Quest offers special programs that can provide companies with cash back on cancellations.
Support Channels:  Multiple contact options are available on the Quest Support page, including email, phone, and video chat.
Seat Selection: Quest allows seat selection during checkout. However, airline loyalty programs often enable seat upgrades using your member status.
Post-Booking Seat Changes:  Most airline websites permit seat changes after receiving your confirmation email.
Remember:
Following these best practices can streamline your event travel experience, ensuring a smooth journey from booking to arrival.

Best Practices for Air Analysis in Corporate Events
Learn key factors and best practices for conducting an air analysis to balance cost savings with program feasibility in corporate events and offsites.
Kenny Totten
When planning team offsites, incentive trips, or corporate meetings, companies face the challenge of balancing cost savings with the feasibility of the program.
Air travel is often one of the largest expenses in these events, making a thorough air analysis crucial to ensuring that budgets are met without compromising the quality of the program. Below, we outline the key factors to consider and the best practices to follow when conducting an air analysis.
Key Factors to Analyze
1. Size of Your Program
The size of your group significantly impacts your air travel budget. As your group size increases, so does the complexity of securing affordable airfare. Airlines typically price their seats in tiers, with the lowest-priced seats selling out first.
For large groups of over 200 people, it s common to see budgets underestimated by as much as 25%. This is due to the increased demand for seats, driving up the price as more tickets are purchased.
2. Time Restrictions
The more restrictive your arrival and departure times are, the higher your airfare costs are likely to be.
For instance, if you require all attendees to arrive between 1:00 PM and 2:00 PM, you ll face limited flight options, pushing up the prices. Similarly, tight departure windows can also lead to higher costs as fewer flights are available within those specific times.
3. Location of the Destination
Choosing a destination with a major international airport can greatly impact the affordability and feasibility of your program. Large groups benefit from the greater availability of flights and competitive pricing that major hubs offer.
Conversely, smaller regional airports often have fewer flights and higher prices. For programs over 200 people, we recommend avoiding smaller airports like Palm Springs (PSP), Reno-Tahoe (RNO), and similar locations.
4. Hubs
If you have a significant number of attendees traveling from the same airport, this concentration should be a key consideration in your analysis. Most domestic flights on popular aircraft, such as the Airbus A321 or Boeing 737, have around 120-140 seats in economy.
With limited availability, not all of your attendees may be able to fly on the same plane. For groups with over 100-150 people departing from a single airport, it may be worth exploring charter flight options to ensure everyone arrives on time.
Understanding How Airlines Sell Their Seats: The Role of Fare Classes
Airlines use a system called fare classes to manage the pricing of seats on a flight.
These fare classes, often referred to as  buckets,  represent different price points within the same cabin (such as economy). The key thing to understand is that while two passengers might be seated next to each other in the same section of the plane, they could have paid very different prices for their tickets.
Here s how it works:
Initial Pricing:
When a flight is first loaded for sale, the airline offers a limited number of seats at the lowest fare class, let s say $350 for an economy seat.
Demand Increases:
As more seats are booked, these lower-priced fare classes begin to sell out, and the airline automatically moves to the next fare class, which could be priced higher, say $400.
Last-Minute Demand:
As the departure date approaches and fewer seats remain, the prices can increase even further, with the highest fare classes sometimes costing significantly more than the initial offerings.
Example Scenario:
Let s consider a group of 40 people looking to book the same flight, with the initial economy seat priced at $350.
Week 1, Day 1:
The first 10 tickets are purchased at $350, which depletes the lowest fare class available for this flight.
Week 1, Day 3:
As more tickets are bought, the next 15 tickets are available at $400, as the initial fare class is sold out.
Week 2, Day 7:
By the time the remaining 15 seats are purchased, the price has increased again, with the final fare class available at $450 per seat.
By the end of this two-week purchasing cycle, the average price paid per ticket may be higher than anticipated, with the group potentially paying between $350 and $450 per seat. This incremental price increase is a crucial consideration when budgeting for large groups, as the overall cost can quickly escalate as seats are sold.
Estimating Your Budget
Using AllFly s Forecast Tool
AllFly offers a powerful tool called Forecast, which helps you build accurate budgets for airfare. This tool takes into account various factors, providing you with a detailed estimate to better plan your travel expenses.

.
Contracting with AllFly for a Custom Analysis
For a more tailored approach, you can contract with a member of the AllFly team to conduct a custom analysis.
Our experts provide in-depth insights on a per-project basis, starting at $85 per hour. This option is ideal if you require a comprehensive analysis specific to your event.
Running Your Own Search
If you prefer to run your own analysis, using tools like Google Flights is a great starting point.
However, be sure to consider both departure and return flights in your search. Google Flights initially shows basic economy fares, but most business travelers fly in standard economy, which typically costs $60-$150 more. This difference should be factored into your budget calculations.
Considerations for Large Programs
Size of Your Program:
Larger groups drive up demand and prices, especially as lower-cost seats sell out. Always budget with a buffer, particularly for groups over 200 people, to avoid underestimating costs by 25% or more.
Time Restrictions:
The tighter your schedule, the fewer flight options you have, leading to higher prices. Flexibility in arrival and departure times can help keep costs down.
Location of the Destination:
Opt for cities with major international airports to maximize flight availability and competitive pricing. For example, if you re considering a smaller airport like Palm Springs, think twice if your group is large.
Hubs:
When a significant portion of your attendees are flying out of the same airport, pay special attention to the available routes and aircraft capacity. For very large groups, chartering a flight might be a more efficient solution.
Conclusion
Running an air analysis for team offsites, incentive trips, and corporate meetings requires careful consideration of several key factors.
By understanding the impact of group size, time restrictions, destination choice, and hub concentration, along with how airlines price their seats, you can create a realistic budget that balances cost savings with program feasibility. Whether you use AllFly s tools, contract with our team, or run your own analysis, these best practices will help ensure a smooth and successful event.

Nick Gray's "2-Hour Cocktail Party" book offers party planning gold! Boost meetings & events with his tips - for business or fun (
Kenny Totten
Nick Gray, entrepreneur and author of The 2-Hour Cocktail Party: How to Build Big Relationships at Small Gatherings is a treasure trove of insights and practical tips on how to throw better parties and events. The corporate meeting world and individuals alike stand to learn a lot from his unique insights.
What makes a great event?
Is it the venue? The company? The drinks?
Nick Gray, entrepreneur and author of
The 2-Hour Cocktail Party: How to Build Big Relationships at Small Gatherings
, has hosted hundreds of parties and has turned throwing events into a science.
In the coming weeks and months, startups and business alike will throw team offsites, cocktail, and holiday parties. These events are designed to connect people and build better relationships with the members of your team and community. By following a few of Nick s simple tips, you can ensure your party hits the mark!
First, Nick highly recommends a cocktail party opposed to a dinner party. Dinner parties can have a  clumping  effect meaning you are sat next to the same few people and have little opportunities to mingle with new party goers. He also listed the complications and disruption of flow that food can have on an event.
Snacks and finger foods, perhaps a charcuterie board, will be enough to keep people satisfied and on their feet! And yes, it is our job as the host to encourage standing, movement, mingling, and dancing (sure why not). It is the facilitator, or host s, job to keep the party flowing. In Nick s book, he has a very specific structure to the party, but we don t want to give away all the gold!
 
Here s an acronym coined by Nick Gray himself that guarantees connection amongst your attendees. Let s dive into the
NICK
party formula.
N
ame tags.
Inform all attendees they will be wearing name tags at the event. Let s face it, remembering a bunch of new names can be overwhelming. Having everyone at the party/event where name tags removes a big point of friction when making new connections.
I
ce breakers.
Ice breakers are a great way to relax a room. Nick states the three different levels of ice breakers (green, yellow, and the daunting red) and the importance of picking one that creates zero judgment and is simple to answer. Example of a green icebreaker being  what s your favorite breakfast food  and a red being  what s your greatest fear . Yikes, right? Let s stick with green and keep the party light and fun!
C
ocktails.
This could be wine or mixed drinks or an assortment of non-alcoholic beverages for people to enjoy. Nick recommends straying from beer because  beer drinkers are brand loyal. 
K
ick everyone out at the end.
Creating a defined time limit for the party relieves a level of anxiety on party and attendance length. No reason for the Irish Goodbye at a Nick Gray themed party, the host is responsible for keeping the fun to two hours.
When it comes to the size of the party, Nick suggests that you aim for between around 15 people. In a corporate setting, you may be forced to host a larger number of people. If that does happen, Nick had some unique insights into parties that ventured just outside of his framework of the home hosted cocktail party of 15 people.
Let s say your team dinner was sixty people. First, Nick recommends attempting to throw a cocktail hour prior to being locked in for dinner.
Once your event moves to dinner, Nick recommends splitting into smaller groups, with the magic number of people around a dinner table being six, which allows for everyone to contribute to the conversation without fracturing into smaller groups.
Whether you are responsible for hosting a team event in a business setting, or throwing a cocktail party for friends in your home, the conversation with Nick and Conner is worth a listen! You can also
find his book
.

Customer Success Story: Launch Potato's Offsite with AllFly
AllFly is dedicated to exceptional service. Alison Preiss of Launch Potato had a seamless retreat with us for PotatoCon 2024, highlighting our commitment to excellence
Molly Lombardo
At AllFly, our dedication to providing unparalleled service and exceptional travel experiences is the cornerstone of our success.
We're always thrilled to receive referrals from our valued partners, and today, we want to highlight a recent success story featuring Alison Preiss, Senior Events Manager, from
Launch Potato
, referred by our esteemed Referral Partner, HPN Global.
HPN Global is renowned for being one of the largest and most global Site Selection and Venue Finding companies. Their unique business model, combined with their unparalleled service, has cemented their position as industry leaders.
HPN Global's team is the most experienced in the industry, and their platform focuses on building effective relationships and delivering exemplary customer service. What sets HPN apart is their proprietary internal sourcing system, which offers unmatched speed, efficiency, and data capture.
Launch Potato's All-Company Retreat: PotatoCon 2024
Launch Potato is a digital media company with 150 employees across 18 countries. Last month, Preiss and her global team at Launch Potato headed to Georgia for this year's much-anticipated company retreat, PotatoCon 2024.
Organizing a seamless and enjoyable retreat was paramount, and Preiss and the Launch Potato team trusted AllFly to handle the travel logistics. We were committed to ensuring that every detail was meticulously planned and executed.
A Life-Saving Experience
The Launch Potato team was particularly impressed with our reporting and billing processes. Preiss described AllFly as a "total life saver," highlighting how our streamlined systems made managing the retreat's logistics effortless and saved her significant time.
To gauge the event experience, Preiss had everyone who attended the retreat take a post event survey, which included a few questions about their AllFly experience.  Overall, AllFly received a 5-star rating across the board.
Listening and Evolving: Quest's Impact
While the feedback was overwhelmingly positive, there was one area for improvement: seat selection. Many attendees expressed a desire to have the ability to select their seats during the booking process.
At AllFly, we believe in continuously improving our services based on customer feedback. We're excited to announce that our new product, Quest, addresses this issue directly.
Quest enhances the booking experience by allowing users to select their seats, ensuring a more personalized and comfortable journey.
 
Commitment to Excellence
Preiss' experience with AllFly is a testament to our commitment to excellence. We listen to our clients, value their feedback, and make necessary changes to enhance our products and services.
We're proud to partner with HPN Global and other industry leaders to deliver the best possible travel experiences.
At AllFly, our mission is to make travel management easy for everyone. Whether you're planning a corporate retreat, an incentive trip, or any other travel event, we're here to provide seamless and stress-free solutions.
Thank you, Alison and Launch Potato, for trusting us with your retreat, and thank you to HPN Global for the invaluable referral. We look forward to many more successful collaborations in the future.

Delta to offer free WiFi on domestic flights

Delta to offer free WiFi on domestic flights
Delta spends $1 billion to offer free Wifi on domestic flights.
Kenny Totten
Free Wi-Fi? Yes, please!
It s finally here! While Wi-Fi has been offered on a number of airlines for a while, passengers who wish to enjoy it have been required to fork over funds for access. However, travelers who want to stay connected during those long business flights can finally enjoy fully functional and FREE Wi-Fi, no payment necessary!
Delta s CEO, Ed Bastian, announced the news this week, stating,  It s free. There s no fine print. We have invested over $1 billion to create this.  According to reports, free Wi-Fi will be offered on about 80% of Delta s domestic fleet next month, with the service becoming available on more planes each week. By the end of the year, free Wi-Fi will be available on over 700 planes; Delta plans to offer free Wi-Fi on regional and international aircraft by the end of 2024.
The free Wi-Fi, available starting February 1
st
, is offered through a sponsorship from T-Mobile. In order to access the service, travelers will log in using their Delta SkyMiles account. Don t have a Delta SkyMiles account? No worries! Becoming a member is free (and did we mention it now comes with FREE Wi-Fi on Delta flights?).
As if that wasn t enough incentive to start traveling on Delta more frequently, the company also announced exciting summer plans: new in-flight entertainment systems.  But I thought Delta already had in-flight entertainment?  Yes, but now, your preferences will carry over different airplanes.
You were in the middle of watching that new release, but your plane landed early? No problem, Delta s new in-flight entertainment systems can now remember where you left off, so you can catch the rest of the film on your return flight. It s like your own personal Netflix in the air. (Or, if you actually wanted to watch your own personal Netflix, you can do that too, for free.)
While other airlines do offer Wi-Fi, in-flight entertainment, and other services, they typically charge for those perks, and the amount can vary depending on your frequent flyer status. With Delta, you no longer have to pick and choose what you want to pay for, or worry that you don t have enough miles for the year. Their Wi-Fi is now free and available to all passengers. Happy travels!

Employee Wellness is a Growing Priority in Business Travel
Biz travel goes wellness-focused! Companies personalize trips for employee well-being
Molly Lombardo
Business travel has a notorious reputation for causing stress and promoting unhealthy habits. In the old days, wellness-minded travelers would be ecstatic to find a local salad joint or a hotel with a decent gym. But come on, that's just basic survival.
The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically shifted the priorities of business travel coordinators and companies towards employee wellness.
According to Josh Gunn, head of product marketing for Corporate Travel Management (CTM), the pandemic completely flipped the wellness concept in business travel. Instead of enhancing the travel experience, the focus shifted to preventing illness and addressing the risk of burnout.
Personalized Approaches for Employee Well-being
CTM has responded by adopting a more personalized approach, setting up a score system to measure the impact of travel on individuals, taking into account factors like early starts, red-eye flights, and long-haul itineraries.
They aim to better track and manage potential health impacts, offering alternative suggestions for trips, such as adding a hotel stay before an early meeting.
Francesca Mendola, Vice President of Global Travel Collection (GTC), highlighted the importance of a holistic approach to encourage healthy habits among business travelers.
GTC has arranged for yoga mats and Peloton bikes to be delivered to clients' rooms and has explored partnerships with local gyms to allow travelers to join classes while away.
They have also incorporated elements of leisure travel into business trips, providing a sense of calm and a home away from home for travelers.
The Role of Companies in Promoting Wellness
While the focus on wellness is welcomed by many, Clive Wratten, Chief Executive of the Business Travel Association, emphasized the need for the industry to do more to understand the impact of extensive business travel on individuals.
He suggested that companies need to introduce more personalized programs to keep people healthy, as the needs of a 25-year-old traveler may differ significantly from those of someone in their 60s.
CIVANA Wellness Resort & Spa
At AllFly, we've witnessed a noticeable shift towards wellness in business travel. Recently, one of our partners chose
CIVANA Wellness Resort & Spa
in Carefree, Arizona, for their offsite.
Nestled in the Sonoran Desert just outside Scottsdale, CIVANA is dedicated to four key pillars
: Movement, Spa, Nourishment, and Discovery.
Under the Movement pillar, guests can join complimentary movement and fitness classes daily, including activities like morning hikes, aerial yoga, and TRX training. For those seeking relaxation, CIVANA offers three pools on the property.
CIVANA's spa boasts 22 treatment rooms, offering therapeutic and rejuvenating treatments focused on healing through water. The Aqua Vitality circuit, Watsu therapy pool, and other amenities leave guests feeling relaxed and rejuvenated.
In terms of Nourishment, CIVANA's culinary philosophy revolves around the belief that true health stems from nature. The menu is plant-rich and seasonal, offering a wide range of options suitable for everyone.
Under Discovery, CIVANA is committed to providing avenues for change, growth, and discovery, whether through new experiences, relationships, or a deeper understanding of oneself.
Guests can partake in activities like meditation on the yoga lawn or share a glass of wine with a friend, leaving them feeling changed, even if just a little, when they depart.
Prioritizing Employee Wellness in Business Travel
As business travel continues to evolve, prioritizing employee wellness is becoming increasingly crucial.
By embracing a holistic approach and providing personalized solutions, companies can ensure that their employees remain healthy, engaged, and productive while on the road.
The shift towards wellness in business travel is not just a trend but a necessary step towards a healthier and more sustainable future for corporate travel.

Don't get denied access through TSA due to REAL ID changes
On May 3rd, 2023 you must have a compliant ID to board an airplane, here is everything you need to know.
Kenny Totten
REAL OR NOT REAL?
 
It s travel time again! You re all packed up and ready to go. You arrived at the airport early, with plenty of time for lines or unexpected delays. You checked in and have your boarding pass. But when you get to the TSA Security Checkpoint, suddenly, they are Gandalf, and you the Balrog: you aren t allowed to pass.
What went wrong?
Looking down, you dejectedly realize that your ID is not REAL ID compliant. Oops. So how do you fix it? And what is REAL ID anyway?
A Bit of Background:
The REAL ID Act was passed by Congress in 2005 at the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. The main purpose was to  set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver's licenses,  with the goal being to strengthen security standards for identification cards. The ensuing regulations are designed to require states to meet these standards as well as prohibit federal agencies from accepting identification cards from states who do not. The most common form of ID this affects is state-issued driver s licenses.
The Deadline Extended:
In April 2021, the Department of Homeland Security extended the REAL ID enforcement deadline due to the COVID-19 pandemic:
 Beginning
May 3, 2023
, every air traveler 18 years of age and older will need a REAL ID-compliant driver s license or identification card, state-issued enhanced driver s license, or another TSA-acceptable form of identification at airport security checkpoints for domestic air travel. 
What Does That Mean for Me?
If you don t like to travel, probably nothing. However, if you want to fly through TSA, then you might want to double check that your main form of ID is in compliance. Likely, this will be a state-issued driver s license or other state-issued photo identity card. (A complete list of acceptable forms of identification for TSA can be found here on their website:
 
)
For many state-issued driver s licenses, the REAL ID compliance is marked with a star at the top of the card. Some states issue state-issued enhanced driver s licenses, which are marked with a flag. Both are acceptable forms of identification. If your driver s license is not REAL ID compliant, or you do not have a driver s license, you will need another form of acceptable identification from the list above. (Note: when traveling within the United States, children under the age of 18 do not need to provide identification if traveling with a companion. However, the companion will need to provide identification from the list above.)
To obtain a REAL ID-compliant license, check your state s DMV website for the list of documents you will need to bring. These documents typically include proof of citizenship or residency, your social security card, and documents showing your principal residence. Again, check with your state for the exact list of required documents; you want to ensure you have everything you need so you receive your REAL ID-compliant license before the
May 3, 2023,
deadline.
Once you have your REAL ID-compliant license or other acceptable form of identification, you can sail through TSA and not have to worry about being turned away again (unless you pack a flame thrower don t do that.) Just remember: the deadline has been extended to
May 3, 2023

Don't Let Rogue Travelers Cost Your Business Time, Money, and Safety
AllFly simplifies booking, enforces policies, and tracks for safety and compliance.
Molly Lombardo
The
New York Times
recently highlighted a growing trend:
business travelers booking their own trips outside of company channels
.
This might seem like a harmless act, but for companies, it can be a major headache. Let's explore why AllFly is the perfect solution to keep your business travelers safe, compliant, and saving money.
The Problem: Rogue Travelers
The article describes a phenomenon called "rogue travelers," employees who book flights and hotels themselves instead of using the designated corporate travel tools like AllFly. There are a few reasons why travelers might go rogue:
Convenience:
They might find searching for flights and hotels on their own to be faster and easier.
Points & Rewards:
Some travelers prioritize accumulating personal rewards points over company benefits.
While these reasons might seem understandable, rogue travelers can create big problems for businesses:
Loss of Control Over Travel Spend:
Without a centralized booking system, it's difficult to track and manage travel expenses.
Duty of Care Concerns:
In case of an emergency, it can be difficult to locate employees who haven't booked through approved channels.
AllFly: Your Solution to Rogue Travelers
AllFly is a corporate travel booking tool designed to address these exact challenges. Here's what AllFly offers:
Simplified Booking:
Our user-friendly platform makes booking travel a breeze for employees, keeping them happy and compliant.
Enforced Travel Policy:
AllFly allows you to set clear travel policies and ensures employees book within budget restrictions.
Real-Time Tracking:
Always know where your employees are with our built-in tracking features. This is crucial for ensuring their safety in case of emergencies.
The Rise of Rogue Travelers
Kenneth Diederich, a corporate executive chef, is among the "rogue travelers" who prefer to book their own travel. Despite the availability of corporate travel agents, Mr. Diederich chooses to use online tools like AllFly to book his flights and hotels, citing the allure of reward points as his main motivation.
Many business travelers share his sentiment, seeking the best fares, unique accommodations, and loyalty rewards.
Balancing Control and Freedom
While companies want to control travel costs and ensure employee safety, they also recognize the need to accommodate the preferences of their travelers.
AllFly enables companies to enforce policies regarding travel bookings while allowing employees like Mr. Diederich to book their travel how they want.
By forwarding the out of policy booking confirmations to the corporate travel agent, employees can ensure compliance with company policies and reimbursement for their expenses, while the company maintains visibility over their whereabouts.
The Challenge of Compliance
Managing travel compliance can be challenging, especially as more travelers turn to their smartphones to plan and book trips outside of corporate tools.
Travel management companies acknowledge that the trend of direct booking is here to stay, making compliance difficult to mandate.
However, companies can encourage compliance by requiring travelers to alert the corporate travel department or management company of their bookings, ensuring that duty-of-care standards are met.
Ensuring Safety in an Uncertain World
The safety of business travelers is a top priority, especially in light of global uncertainties such as terrorist attacks. AllFly helps companies mitigate travel risks by providing travel itineraries.
AllFly is a valuable tool for companies looking to manage corporate travel effectively. By enforcing policies, ensuring compliance, and prioritizing employee safety, AllFly empowers companies to navigate the complexities of corporate travel in an ever-changing world.

Establishing Effective Travel Policies with AllFly
Set effective travel policies with AllFly to manage expenses, ensure comfort, and optimize your corporate travel program.
Kenny Totten
Managing corporate travel expenses while ensuring a smooth experience for your employees is a balancing act that requires well-crafted travel policies.
At AllFly, we've streamlined this process, allowing companies to set policies tailored to specific flight durations. This guide will walk you through the key considerations and best practices for setting up your company's travel policies.
Configuring Travel Policies by Flight Duration
AllFly s platform allows you to establish travel policies based on the duration of flights, offering flexibility that ensures your employees travel comfortably while staying within budget constraints. Here s a general recommendation to start with:
0-4 hours:
$500 cap, economy class
4-6 hours:
$800 cap, economy class
6-12 hours:
$1,350 cap, economy & premium economy
12+ hours:
$1,750 cap, economy & premium economy
By tailoring your policies to the length of flights, you strike a balance between cost-effectiveness and traveler comfort. Additionally, we strongly advise against allowing your employees to select basic economy fares due to their restrictive conditions.
In the future, we are exploring the possibility of simplifying these fare brackets, potentially moving from four to three categories: 0-4 hours, 4-8 hours, and 8+ hours.
Everyday Business Travel vs. Event-Based Travel Policies
AllFly s Quest platform provides the flexibility to create travel policies that cater to both everyday business travel and event-specific needs. This distinction is crucial because events often require unique considerations, such as accommodating larger groups or special travel arrangements.
Everyday Business Travel Policies:
These standard policies apply to regular business trips, ensuring consistency and cost control across all routine travel.
Event-Based Travel Policies:
For events, you can craft policies that are tailored to the specific requirements of each occasion. This may include different budget allocations, class of service preferences, or specific routing needs.
It s important to note that event-level travel policies will supersede general everyday business travel policies, ensuring that the specific needs of your event take priority.
Using AllFly s Forecast Tool for Budgeting
Accurate budgeting is essential for effective travel management, and AllFly s Forecast tool can be a valuable asset in this process. The Forecast tool provides insights into median fares, offering a reliable benchmark for setting your travel budget.
Using the median fare as a guide helps you avoid the extremes of overly expensive or unusually cheap fares, giving you a realistic expectation of what you should be paying for flights.
Why You Should Avoid Using Google Flights for Analysis
While Google Flights is a popular tool for checking flight prices, it s not ideal for corporate travel analysis. Here s why:
Basic Economy Pricing:
Google Flights often highlights Basic Economy fares, which are generally unsuitable for corporate travel due to their restrictive conditions, such as limited baggage allowances and non-refundable tickets. The difference between Basic Economy and standard Economy fares can be significant, ranging from $50 to $100.
Impact on Budgeting:
Relying on Google Flights could lead to under-budgeting, as the prices shown may not reflect the true cost of travel for your employees.
For a more accurate analysis, we recommend using AllFly s Forecast tool to ensure your budget aligns with actual corporate travel needs.
Budgeting for Large Groups
When managing travel for groups larger than 150 people, special considerations are necessary. Airlines typically sell the cheapest seats first, so if you re booking for a large group, the initial prices you see online may not represent the final costs.
We recommend budgeting based on the 5th-7th cheapest fare available and adding 50% to account for price increases as cheaper seats sell out. For example, if the initial fare is $450, budgeting at $675 per ticket would be more realistic for large groups.
For groups of 200-300 or more, consider hosting your event near a major international airport to simplify logistics and reduce costs.
Communicating Your Company s Travel Policy to Employees
Clear communication of your company s travel policies is crucial to ensure that all employees understand the rules and expectations, especially regarding cancellations.
When an employee cancels a non-refundable ticket, the value often becomes an eCredit tied to their profile. It s important to instruct employees that these eCredits should be retained for future business travel, not for personal use. By setting and communicating these guidelines upfront, you protect company resources and ensure compliance with your travel policies.
Conclusion
Establishing effective travel policies with AllFly enables you to manage travel expenses while ensuring a comfortable experience for your employees.
By configuring policies based on flight durations, using tools like AllFly s Forecast, and budgeting appropriately for large groups, you can optimize your travel program for both cost and convenience.

Incentivizing Employees: AllFly's Role with Coca-Cola
Employees now prefer personalized travel rewards. Gift A Trip and AllFly offer turnkey travel certificates and flexible flight booking, enhancing employee satisfaction.
Molly Lombardo
As employee preferences continue to evolve when it comes to how they wish to be recognized and rewarded at work, it's important for companies to ensure they re staying current with the trends by offering their employees rewards that they ll find not only motivating, but highly personal, and memorable as well.
A recent survey from
the Incentive Research Foundation (IRF)
found that an average of
59%
of employee respondents preferred Individual Travel (with a guest) as the
#1 reward option
to stay with the organization and perform their best.  That s higher than their preference for flexible work arrangements (49%), merchandise (30%) or group travel with other top performers (12%).
While group incentive trips for top performers are still highly preferred by the C-Suite, there are ways to incorporate individual travel rewards into a Total Rewards strategy.  One company who focuses solely on providing turnkey, individual travel rewards from the top cruise, resort and hotel brands is
Gift A Trip
, based in Orlando, FL.  AllFly is thrilled to announce our partnership with Gift A Trip as their preferred flight provider for these individual travel rewards.
The Concept:
Gift A Trip introduces an exciting new approach to employee incentives by providing companies with the ability to purchase turnkey travel certificates for two, which are inclusive of the accommodations, plus all taxes and fees, gratuities.  They can also add on an
AllFly
flight voucher in any dollar denomination to accompany the trip certificate.
Companies can purchase a single branded trip certificate (such as a Royal Caribbean 3-4 Night Cruise Certificate), or they can purchase a
 Flex Trip Collection 
Certificate, which allows the recipient to choose from any one of six trip options, featuring a wide variety of experiences   all at a set price.  It s Gift A Trip s most popular option, as companies often prefer to let the recipient choose which trip they d enjoy the most.
Allowing the individual the flexibility to choose their destination, their travel dates, as well as their travel companions makes the reward even more thoughtful and meaningful.
How it Works
Whether employees have achieved their sales goals, reached a milestone tenure at the company, or earned an award for other service achievements, once the company has decided on the reward budget, they can purchase the rewards from Gift A Trip either online or over the phone.
It s as easy as 1, 2, 3!
PURCHASE:
Employer selects either an individually branded or Flex Trip certificate.
DELIVER:
Gift A Trip e-mails the company the redeemable digital trip certificate via a secure downloadable link.
REDEEM:
When the recipient is ready to book their trip, they contact the certificate redemption desk directly with the cruise line, resort or hotel.
Seamless Flight Booking with AllFly
Once the recipient has decided on their travel plans, AllFly steps in to help get them there.  As a trusted travel partner, AllFly will book the flights and manage the travel arrangements based on the requests submitted by the recipient.  They can choose from any airline, any flight, and any class of service up to the value of the flight voucher.  Should they choose to upgrade their class or service, or choose a flight that exceeds the voucher value, they can simply pay the difference.  This flexible and streamlined process ensures that your employees have a hassle-free booking experience from start to finish.
Certificate Support for Coca-Cola
At AllFly, we are committed to providing customized travel solutions to meet the unique needs of our clients.  For Coca-Cola, we have developed a dedicated website where employees can easily send over their travel details.  This platform is designed to keep things automated, fast and streamlined.
Here s how it works:
User-Friendly Interface
: Coca-Cola employees can log into the dedicated website and input their travel preferences and voucher details.
Automated Processing
: The system automatically processes the information, ensuring that all travel arrangements are aligned with the employee's requests.
Streamlined Communication
: The platform allows for easy communication between the employee and AllFly, reducing the time and effort required to finalize travel plans.
Efficiency and Accuracy
: By automating the travel booking process, we minimize errors and ensure that each trip is booked accurately and efficiently.
This personalized approach not only enhances the travel booking experience for Coca-Cola employees but also ensures that the entire process is seamless and efficient, reflecting AllFly's commitment to excellence.
Why Choose Gift A Trip?
Choice:
With over 35 hotel, resort and cruise line brands to choose from, there s something for every budget, and every kind of travel experience.
Flexibility:
Certificates are valid for year-round travel, with minimal blackout dates.  Guest can also upgrade their accommodations, extend their stay, or even add more guests to the reservation.
Personalization
: Employees get to choose their travel dates as well as their travel companions.
Inclusive:
Certificates always include all taxes, resort fees, and gratuities.  This means that your recipient will not have to pay these fees out of pocket for the trip they ve earned.

Peacocks at airports? New pet travel rules sparked by a Newark stowaway!
Kenny Totten
Over the last few years, the rules have changed surrounding what you can and cannot do when traveling with pets. The changing rules can be traced back to a peacock traversing through Newark airport.
A few years ago, the skies were filled with flying "emotional support animals." Like all good things, people abused it and ESA animals became a giant grift.
It all came to a head when a woman tried to bring an emotional support peacock onto a plane at Newark airport.
After that incident, legislation got passed and the airlines banned ESA animals.
You can travel with your dog, cat, or household bird in the main cabin, but it has to fit under the seatback in front of you. The suggested size is 11" x 18" x 11". Each airline has fees associated with traveling with a pet in cabin.
Should you want to travel with a larger animal, they will have to be a service animal. The Travel Nerds podcast covers the topic well.

Elevating Team Offsites: AllFly vs. Navan
With event-centric features, personalized service, and attentive partnership, AllFly elevates your team offsites to new heights
Lizzy Czyz
In the fast-paced world of team events and corporate offsites, every detail matters. From seamless bookings to unexpected snags, your travel management partner needs to be more than just a booking portal. They should be your co-pilot, navigating the turbulence and ensuring your journey lands smoothly. But in the crowded airspace of travel management giants like Navan, can smaller players like AllFly compete?
Buckle up, because we're about to chart a course towards a world where personalized service, event-centric planning, and budget-savvy solutions take center stage.
Quest
for Excellence: Beyond Expenses, Towards Experiences
Let's face it, traditional travel management platforms like Navan excel in the realm of expense reports and compliance. But what about the heart and soul of corporate travel   creating unforgettable team experiences? That's where AllFly's Quest platform takes flight. Built with offsites and events as its north star, Quest offers a host of features that Navan simply can't match:
Event-Level Management: Say goodbye to travel chaos and fragmented itineraries. Quest lets you create dedicated events, streamlining bookings, budgets, and communication for each unforgettable adventure. No more sifting through mountains of invoices to track team offsite expenses.
Ticket Protection Plan: The dreaded eCredit stands accused! AllFly's unique plan converts canceled airline tickets into cash back, mitigating travel disruptions and protecting your company's precious budget.
Split Pay for Seamless Upgrades: Let the wanderlust flow! Quest's innovative split pay feature empowers travelers to upgrade their seats with ease, covering the difference themselves. No more rigid policies or company frowns   just happy colleagues soaring in first class comfort.
Customer Service: From Weeds to Red Carpet
Let's be honest, travel hiccups happen. And when they do, wouldn't you rather have a dedicated team on your side? AllFly understands this, putting its size to your advantage. Unlike Navan, where large-scale operations can leave smaller companies feeling lost in the crowd, AllFly offers personalized service with a human touch. Each account is paired with a dedicated sales and account manager, acting as an extension of your in-house travel team. No more phone tag or faceless email chains   just real people, real solutions, and genuine care for your travel success.
Size Matters: Your Company Deserves to be No. 1
In the vast universe of Navan's 7,000 clients, it's easy to feel like a blip on the radar. But at AllFly, with its intimate family of 300, your company is the star of the show. Every account receives meticulous attention, ensuring your travel program thrives, not survives. Wouldn't you rather be the captain of your own ship, rather than a forgotten cabin passenger on a behemoth cruise liner?
The Choice is Clear: Fly High with AllFly
When it comes to team offsites and event travel, choosing the right partner is an investment in your company's well-being, productivity, and ultimately, success. While Navan holds its own in the expense management arena, AllFly takes off with a different mission: to empower your team, elevate your experiences, and prioritize your peace of mind every step of the journey.
So, ditch the turbulence of generic platforms and chart a course for an event-centric, service-driven travel experience. With Quest and AllFly by your side, your team offsites will reach new heights, leaving lasting memories (and no eCredits) in their wake.
Ready to embark on a travel adventure tailor-made for your team? Contact AllFly today and discover the difference between managing expenses and embracing experiences.
This blog strikes a balance between acknowledging Navan's strengths and highlighting AllFly's unique value proposition. By focusing on event-centric features, personalized service, and the benefits of being a smaller, more attentive partner, this message positions AllFly as the ideal choice for companies who prioritize unforgettable team experiences and a personal touch in their travel management.
Remember, this is just a starting point. Feel free to customize the blog by incorporating specific data points, customer testimonials, or even a touch of humor to further showcase AllFly's unique personality and appeal. Happy travels!

Important Update: Changes to AllFly s Ticket Protection Plan
Ticket Protection Plan for Delta, American, and United Airlines corporate travel bookings ends after June 1, 2024, due to policy changes.
Kenny Totten
We hope this message finds you well. We are writing to inform you of an important update regarding our Ticket Protection Plan for economy tickets on Delta, American, and United Airlines.
Effective immediately, our Ticket Protection Plan will be sunsetted for all corporate travel programs booking after June 1, 2024. This change is necessary due to recent modifications in the airlines' rules and policies.
It s important to note that the TPP is still a part of our Group Contracts offering. Group Contracts are a special product that airlines sell and require 10+ people to be on the same exact flight. We do NOT recommend group contracts for corporate and event travel, and most of our customers take our advice.
Key Dates to Remember
June 1, 2024:
Last day to book programs that will be covered by the Ticket Protection Plan.
July 1, 2024
: The official end date for the Ticket Protection Plan. Any tickets issued after this date will not be covered by the plan, regardless of when the program began booking.
Impact on Your Bookings
Programs that began booking prior to June 1, 2024, will still be covered under the Ticket Protection Plan, as long as tickets are issued by June 30, 2024.
For programs booking after June 1, 2024, the Ticket Protection Plan will no longer be available.
Managing the Transition
If your program began booking before June 1, 2024,, the TPP will still be honored until the final cutoff on July 1, 2024. After this date, all tickets purchased will not be eligible for the TPP.
Our Future Plans
To address this gap, we are working diligently to introduce the option to purchase refundable tickets directly within Quest. This new offering will provide similar benefits to the Ticket Protection Plan, allowing you to secure more flexible travel arrangements.
Managing Canceled Tickets
In the corporate travel world, non-refundable tickets that are canceled typically result in an e-credit on the traveler s profile. We understand this can be frustrating for companies trying to manage travel expenses efficiently. We recommend establishing internal travel policies to govern these situations, and we are here to offer our expertise and consultation to help you navigate these changes.
We appreciate your understanding and continued support as we adapt to these new circumstances. Should you have any questions or need further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to our support team.
Thank you for choosing AllFly for your corporate travel needs.
Best regards,
The AllFly Team

How Stipend Mode Works
Stipend Mode (beta) allows travel managers to set a fixed amount the company will contribute to an employees flights.
Nathaniel Comeaux
At AllFly, we continually strive to enhance our travel experience, ensuring it meets the evolving needs of our clients. We re excited to introduce a new feature designed to simplify and streamline event travel: Stipend Mode. This innovative tool is perfect for companies looking to manage travel expenses while offering their employees flexibility and choice.
Stipend Mode is currently in private beta, and will be folded into Quest later this year.
What is Stipend Mode?
Stipend Mode is specifically tailored for event travel. It allows companies to set a fixed dollar amount for flight expenses for their travelers. Here s how it works:
1.
Company Sets a Stipend:
Before the event, the company determines a fixed amount they are willing to pay for each traveler s airfare. For instance, Google might allocate $400 per employee for an off-site event in Cabo.
2.
Traveler Chooses Flights:
Employees can select their preferred flights, whether they want to fly economy or upgrade to business class.
3.
Cost Management:
If the chosen flight exceeds the set stipend, the traveler is responsible for paying the difference at checkout. If the flight costs less than the stipend, the remaining amount is refunded to the company.
How Stipend Mode Works: A Case Study
Let s consider a practical example to illustrate the benefits and functionality of Stipend Mode.
Scenario: Google s Off-Site Event in Cabo
Google plans an off-site event for 100 of its top salespeople in Cabo. They decide to use AllFly to manage their travel arrangements and allocate $400 for each employee s airfare.
1.
Setting the Stipend:
Google communicates to AllFly that each traveler has a $400 budget for their flight.
2.
Booking Process:
Employees receive this information and begin booking their flights through Quest. They can choose any flight, with the understanding that they are responsible for any costs exceeding $400.
3.
Checkout:
An employee selects a flight costing $450. At checkout, they pay the additional $50 using a credit card, which they can enter at the payment stage. Additionally, there is a 4% service charge on the total amount owed by the traveler, which in this case would be $2 (4% of $50), making the total additional payment $52. Another employee finds a flight for $380; they do not receive a refund for the $20 difference, and AllFly retains the remaining amount. During the BETA period, travelers will pay the remaining balance via an invoice sent to their email. Once Stipend Mode exits its BETA period and becomes a part of Quest, travelers will get to pay the remaining balance via credit card on the checkout screen.
Benefits of Stipend Mode
 
Cost Control:
Companies have a clear and predictable budget for travel expenses.
 
Flexibility:
Employees can choose flights that best suit their preferences, whether they prioritize cost savings or additional comfort.
 
Streamlined Management:
AllFly handles the financial logistics, ensuring a smooth and efficient process for both the company and the travelers.
Why Choose Stipend Mode?
Stipend Mode offers a balanced approach to managing event travel expenses. Companies maintain control over their budgets, while employees enjoy the freedom to select their preferred flights. This feature underscores AllFly s commitment to providing innovative solutions that enhance the corporate travel experience.

Introducing Magic Link: Revolutionizing Event Travel Management
Magic Link: Effortlessly manage event travel with AllFly s Quest. Invite attendees and simplify booking.
Molly Lombardo
At AllFly, we're committed to making event travel management as seamless and efficient as possible. That's why we're excited to introduce Magic Link, a powerful new feature in our Quest platform designed to simplify the process of inviting attendees to events and booking their travel.
What is Magic Link?
Magic Link is a unique URL that streamlines the entire event invitation and booking process.
When attendees click on the Magic Link, they are instantly invited to your company's Quest workspace, attached to the specific event, and ready to book their travel all within your company's travel policy. This feature takes the hassle out of managing large groups, making the entire process more efficient and user-friendly.
Inviting Attendees to Your Event
While there are several ways to add attendees to your event, the Magic Link feature is by far the most popular and seamless option.
After completing the necessary steps, you can share the Magic Link in a registration confirmation or welcome email. This allows meeting planners and event administrators to control the messaging and timing of when attendees can access Quest.
Alternatively, you can add attendees manually by clicking the "Add Attendees" button. However, it's important to note that Quest does not automatically send out invitation links when someone is added manually, so using the Magic Link is recommended for a smoother process.
How to Use Magic Link
Getting started with Magic Link is simple:
Go to the Event Details
in Quest.
Navigate to the "Attendees" tab
to manage your invitees.
Click "Copy Event Link"
to generate your Magic Link.
Share the Magic Link
in a welcome email or through your registration platform.
When attendees click the Magic Link, they'll be connected to your event and can book their flights within your company's travel guidelines, ensuring everything runs smoothly.
Pro Tips for Making Your Event a Success
With years of experience in booking and managing events, we've gathered some best practices to help you make the most of your event:
Avoid Launching Events on Thursdays or Fridays:
While AllFly offers 24/7 support, coverage is lighter on weekends, which could lead to delays in addressing any issues.
Plan Arrival Activities After 6 PM:
To avoid budget overruns and logistical nightmares, it's best to schedule activities after 6 PM on arrival day. Restrictive travel times can lead to significantly higher airfare costs up to 20-30% more if requiring arrivals between 11 AM and 3 PM.
Communicate Booking Rules Clearly:
Before launching travel, ensure all attendees understand the booking rules and expectations. This clarity will enhance the attendee experience and reduce support issues.
Choose Venues Near Major International Airports:
For larger events, proximity to major airports like New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, or Miami is crucial. For events with over 300 attendees, smaller regional airports may not be practical.
Stay on Top of Approvals:
Travel agencies can only hold fares for 24 hours. Assign someone to monitor approvals closely, as reservations not addressed within this timeframe will cancel, forcing travelers to re-shop for flights at potentially higher prices.
Getting Support
AllFly is committed to providing a high-touch customer service experience from start to finish. Before your trip is set up in Quest, your dedicated sales manager will guide you through the process. Once your trip is live, our customer success and account management teams are ready to handle any support issues that may arise.
We hope Magic Link will become an essential feature in your event planning arsenal, making event travel management more efficient and stress-free!

AI: Friend or Foe? Kenny & Conner Ann's SITE Texas Recap
Unlock the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with insights from industry experts Kenny and Conner Ann.
Molly Lombardo
CLICK HERE TO WATCH ON YOUTUBE!
Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just a buzzword; it's rapidly becoming an integral part of our lives. Kenny and Conner Ann, two industry experts, recently delivered a captivating keynote speech at the SITE Texas Roadshow conference, shedding light on the future of AI.
Their mission? To help people understand that AI can be a valuable tool rather than a threat. In this blog post, we'll recap the key takeaways from their enlightening talk.
Changing Perceptions: AI as a Friend, Not a Foe
Kenny and Conner Ann's central goal during their presentation was to change the way we perceive AI. They aimed to convince the audience that AI can be a friend and not a foe. In their dynamic talk, they also provided valuable insights and skills that can empower individuals to make the most of AI technology in their personal and professional lives.
The Expanding Landscape of AI
When most people think of AI, giants like Google and ChatGPT come to mind. While these platforms are undoubtedly significant players, Kenny and Conner Ann highlighted that AI has a much broader scope.
They explained how voice cloning, for instance, is one of AI's newest features, with far-reaching implications, especially in the customer service sector.
Imagine having AI travel agents that could call airlines on your behalf and perform various tasks. This technology, though in its infancy, is expected to revolutionize customer service.
Insights from the Dog's Mind
The presenters also delved into AI's ability to decode brain signals. Researchers in Scotland conducted an intriguing experiment involving dogs and humans in MRI machines.
The study revealed that AI could decode the action classifiers in dog MRI scans, highlighting that dogs process the world differently from humans.
This exciting development hints at the possibility of one day understanding our pets' thoughts and communication.
AI Empowering Medicine
One of the most heartening aspects of AI's impact is its ability to transform the medical field. Kenny and Conner Ann shared a remarkable study that found AI-supported mammogram screening increased breast cancer detection by 20%. This technology has the potential to save countless lives and make a significant dent in global breast cancer statistics.
The Power of Chat GPT and Google Bard
Kenny and Conner Ann also touched on the power of chat-based AI like Chat GPT and Google Bard. They emphasized how these platforms are evolving rapidly and are exceptionally useful in various scenarios.
For example, Chat GPT's Ask Your PDF plugin can read and analyze PDFs, making it a valuable tool for contract review and analysis. It can summarize lengthy documents and answer questions about their contents, providing remarkable utility for professionals.
AI's Impact on Travel and Event Planning
Kenny and Conner Ann shared their own tool, "Forecast," which facilitates trip budgeting and planning. They showed how AI can quickly estimate program costs, provide airport insights, and create itemized city pair routes, streamlining the process of organizing travel events for large groups.
 
AI in Contract Negotiations
The presenters also demonstrated how AI can assist in contract negotiations. By uploading a services agreement, you can ask the AI to identify non-standard terms or negotiate key clauses. This technology can save time and money, making it a valuable resource for professionals dealing with vendors.
Kenny and Conner Ann's keynote speech at the SITE Texas Roadshow conference showcased the remarkable potential of AI and the myriad ways it can be a valuable asset in our lives.
As AI continues to advance and integrate into various industries, it's clear that it has the power to be a friend, not a foe. The future is filled with exciting possibilities, and by understanding and embracing AI, we can all be better prepared to navigate the ever-changing landscape of technology.

New Federal Rules Ensure Cash Refunds for Flight Disruptions
Pete Buttigieg's new rules promise automatic cash refunds for canceled flights.
Molly Lombardo
In a significant development for air travelers, new federal rules announced by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg are set to revolutionize how airlines handle flight disruptions.
These rules mandate that passengers are entitled to automatic
cash refunds if their flight is canceled for any reason, and it must be provided promptly.
Under these rules, if your flight is delayed for more than three hours domestically or six hours internationally, or if there's a significant change to your itinerary such as a change in airports, you are entitled to a cash refund.
This marks a fundamental shift in how airlines are required to compensate passengers for inconveniences beyond their control.
Additionally, the rules require airlines to provide upfront information about fees for baggage and changing flights.
The new rule formalizes the requirement that passengers receive refunds if a domestic flight is delayed by more than three hours or if an international flight is delayed by more than six hours.
It also mandates a refund of any baggage fees for bags that arrive more than 12 hours late, as well as a refund of fees for purchased services like Wi-Fi or upgraded seating if the airline doesn t deliver.
These changes come after a surge in complaints in 2022 about refunds during the coronavirus pandemic, when air travel came to a standstill.
The Biden Administration proposed the change to refund rules in response to the complaints, which totaled nearly 47,600, more than double the number received in 2021.
Many travelers complained that airlines were pushing noncash flight credit or requiring extended time on customer service phone lines to request a refund, with some credits expiring long before travel returned to normal levels.
With these new rules, travelers can expect a more transparent and consumer-friendly experience when dealing with flight disruptions.
Airlines are now required to provide cash refunds promptly and without hassle, ensuring that passengers are fairly compensated for inconveniences beyond their control. This is a significant step forward in protecting the rights and interests of air travelers.

New Promotion for Exclusively for Meeting Planners
Meeting planners, you are one referral away from sipping a martini on a beach in Miami with our new promotion!
Kenny Totten
We have been joining forces with meeting planners to create a killer offering. An offering so good, Ryan Reynolds reached out to be our spokesperson. He knows how to spot an early winner -- see Mint Mobile and Aviation Gin.
(For legal reasons, we are just kidding. But we can manifest, right?)
Anyhow, this promo is for you dear beleaguered meeting planners.
We know group travel planning can be a tear-jerker, and not in the heartwarming, Ryan Reynolds rom-com kind of way. But wipe those tears away, because AllFly is here to save the day (and your sanity).
Introducing AllFly Meetings, the online booking tool that's like having Deadpool himself at your side (minus the red spandex). And if that's not enough to make you feel like a superhero, how about this: when you refer a group to AllFly,
we pay you a per-flight booked referral fee AND give you a FREE flight to anywhere in the continental United States.
That's right, you'll be the envy of the office faster than you can say "Van Wilder."
AllFly Meetings streamlines the booking process like no other, making it easy for your entire team to book flights in one convenient place. No more juggling a million tabs, phone calls, or expense reports!
We're all about efficiency, just like a certain sarcastic anti-hero.
Did we mention we load in discounted fares quicker than Deadpool can spout a witty comeback? That means your company saves money while you save face. Plus, we offer a ticket buyback program on cancelled tickets, because we know plans can change faster than a superhero's costume in a phone booth.
With our reporting suite, coordinating ground transportation is a breeze. You'll have arrival and departure lists at your fingertips, so you'll know when your people touch down. Think of it as your own personal Jarvis, only without the British accent and holographic interface (we're working on it).
So, are you ready to take off with AllFly Meetings and claim your free flight?
Set up a demo
, and
watch a video preview
. Trust us; it's more satisfying than watching Ryan Reynolds deliver a punchline.
Happy flying, and may your meetings be as witty and snarky as this blog post!

Insights from Reposite x AllFly s AI ThinkTank
AllFly hosted an AI-focused educational seminar in partnership with Reposite and the SITE South Florida chapter.
Molly Lombardo
This month, Reposite hosted an AI-focused educational seminar in collaboration with AllFly and the SITE Florida & Caribbean chapter, bringing together professionals from the meetings and events industry.
Held at the vibrant STK Steakhouse in South Beach, the event not only provided valuable insights into the quickly evolving world of AI but also set the stage with its lively ambiance, delectable cuisine, and refreshing drinks!
The evening began with an amazing kickoff from our partners at CityHunt, where the group was brought together with a fun and engaging icebreaker, Unlock the Box!
The seminar drew a full house of enthusiastic attendees eager to explore how AI could revolutionize their events.
Led by industry pioneers Alexa Berube and Kenny Totten, who each founded their own tech companies with a strong reliance on AI, the event offered a plethora of insights and practical tips on integrating AI into the meetings industry.
The session kicked off by describing the overall landscape of AI. A lot of folks seemed to think AI just popped up last year and has since gone viral, but it s actually been around since the 1950s with the first version of a chatbot launching.
The Reposite team covered the six major categories of AI: machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, image generation, robotics, and expert systems and gave some examples of how to best leverage each of these in the meetings and events industry.
A Peek into the Seminar: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI Tools for Meeting Planners
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subset of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language.
It involves tasks like speech recognition, language understanding, and language generation. The most popular examples of NLP tools today are OpenAI/ChatGPT and Google s Gemini (previously known as Bard).
Meeting and event planners can leverage these powerful tools for destination selection, creating event agendas, crafting event invitations, blog posts, social media posts, speaker bios, translating languages, AI-powered chatbots to answer attendee questions, contract reading and understanding, crafting post-event follow-up surveys, analyzing and summarizing data, and more.
Planners who are not yet using NLP may want to start with Gemini, which is free of charge and pulls more live info.
Computer Vision and Other AI Tools
Computer vision is a category of AI that enables computers to interpret and understand the visual world.
It includes facial recognition, which can streamline attendee check-in, and facial analysis, which can provide real-time analytics to help answer such questions as: What content is hot, and what is not? How deeply are we engaging attendees?
In addition to Reposite s AI-driven RFP program to match to the right suppliers for quotes and proposals, other tools for planners include AllFly s Forecast that enables planners to quickly budget airfare.
The rest of the session focused on the latest enhancements made to ChatGPT and Google s Gemini (formerly BARD), as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each of those platforms.
The group then explored some cutting-edge new technologies on the AI market ranging from Synthesia (AI-powered Sales Representatives) to Zenus (Facial Analysis to more effectively measure success at trade shows).
Future Outlook
As AI gets smarter and smarter over time, it will come closer to interacting like a human being, offering ever more effective meeting planning tools.
While these highlights provide a glimpse into the seminar's offerings, there's much more that transpired during the event.
As the saying goes, "for more, you had to be there." But fear not, as Reposite is already gearing up for AI ThinkTank 2.0 in our next destination, Orlando. Stay tuned for updates!
A special thanks to our supporting partner STK Steakhouse for providing the perfect vibes, as well as the delectable food and drinks that fueled engaging discussions throughout the evening.
Key Takeaways
The Current State of AI: Kenny and Conner Ann provided an overview of the current state of AI, highlighting its rapid evolution and increasing impact on various industries, including the meetings industry.
They discussed how AI is being used to streamline operations, enhance attendee experiences, and improve decision-making processes.
How to Write Amazing Prompts:
The speakers introduced the concept of R-T-P (Role-Task-Prompt) and explained how to write effective prompts using AI.
They demonstrated this with an example where a meeting planner requested data about air lift into five different airports.
The prompt was to show the data in a table, providing insights into the amount of passengers each airport can handle and the number of direct flights from three specific airports.
AI Products to Help You Work: Kenny and Conner Ann highlighted several AI products that can assist meeting planners in their work.
They discussed different types o
f AI, including Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Image Generation, Robotics, and Expert Systems.
Each type was briefly described, showcasing its unique capabilities and applications.
Machine Learning
: This type of AI enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.
Natural Language Processing:
NLP enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language, facilitating more natural interactions between humans and machines.
Computer Vision:

Robotics
: Robotics combines AI with physical machines, enabling robots to perform tasks autonomously in various environments.
Expert Systems
: These are AI systems that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert in a specific domain, providing valuable insights and recommendations.

It was this recognition that led to the birth of our product :
AllFly Quest
Naturally, we saw our product as a game-changer for meeting planners, tour operators, and travel managers. Building a product our current clients would adore was just the beginning. The quest for widespread recognition and user engagement called for a whole channel of marketing tactics.

Product Hunt is a bustling hub teeming with investors, entrepreneurs, and potential clients a prime avenue for boosting your product's visibility.
Receive Constructive Feedback:
The Product Hunt community is known for providing constructive feedback. This can help you identify and address issues with your product early on, improving its quality and user experience
Enhance Credibility:
The success of Quest on Product Hunt can be viewed as a form of validation. It can boost your credibility and attract more users and investors if your product gains traction and receives positive feedback on the platform.
 
Step 1: Prepare Your Product Hunt Launch
Create an eye catching teaser:
Demo our Product
: Quest's mission is to simplify corporate travel, and the tool we're introducing combines practicality with eye-catching aesthetics.
 
We wanted our teaser to vividly convey what sets our company apart: Our exceptional team and our cutting-edge platform.
Prepare a landing page:
The AllFly & Quest website page was ready with clear calls to action (CTAs) to direct visitors to sign up or learn more.
Accurate presentation text:
Achieving an accurate description can be challenging. The objective is to provide clear and concise information about Quest, knowing that viewers on Product Hunt might be unfamiliar with booking corporate travel and our competitors.
Connecting with the Product Hunt Community-
Prior to our debut, our team plans to spend the entire month upvoting and commenting on products that we love on Product Hunt. This will give us a voice in the community.
Linking up with a Hunter-
with our Product Hunt page almost ready to launch, we reached out to
Nicolas Greni 
who kindly accepted to be our hunter.
 
Actively participate in discussions on Product Hunt Thread-
Our team sets aside 10 minutes per day to interact with content on Product Hunt.
We plan to befriend a group of people on Product Hunt. We also will collaborate with individuals launching their products inside the 30-day window that would allow for voting.
Post Your Product Hunt Launch on Social Media-
This will encourage your current supporters and promote your launch!
 
 
Step 2: Schedule Your Product Hunt Launch
Choose the Right Time
: The most competitive days are Wednesdays and Thursdays.
So the weekends are ideal if you're just looking for upvotes and less conversions. But if you want to be in the top 5, weekdays are better.
You'll also need to tap a lot of individuals in your network to get them to promote your product and bring in new consumers.
With the help of our hunter, our team decided to launch on a
Thursday.
Step 3: Launch on Product Hunt
It is essential to understand how Product Hunt works because the ranking is not revealed right away once the votes are cast.
You have four hours to make sure that your product is seen and rises to the top of the list. Being at the top greatly enhances the likelihood that people will find your product.
Consequently, the goal is to first mobilize your network to secure the first 100 votes, and then later on to keep accumulating more votes. On average, 200 to 300 people were affected by our activities, with the remaining users of Product Hunt.
Step 4: Engage with the Product Hunt Community
Monitor Comments
: After Quest goes live, we plan to keep a close eye on the comments and questions from the Product Hunt community. We will be responding promptly and engaging with users.
Share on Social Media:
promoting your Product Hunt launch on your social media channels to encourage your existing audience to support and engage with your post on Product Hunt is key.
In a nutshell, we're thrilled to unveil the heart and soul we've poured into Quest on Product Hunt. Get ready for a new look into travel management!

Push for Sustainability in Business Travel
The corporate travel landscape is evolving with sustainability, vacation rentals, and integrated T&E policies. Adaptation and staying informed are key.
Molly Lombardo
As corporate travel continues to evolve, sustainability has become a focal point. Previous research from Skift s report,
"Vacation Rentals on Business Trips? Who Gets the Best Airline Seat?
", has indicated that corporate travel has made few strides toward prioritizing sustainability.
However, recent initiatives by companies and travel decision-makers show a growing commitment to sustainable travel practices. Here s a closer look at the current trends and statistics:

61% of companies encourage business travelers to opt for sustainable options when booking their trips.

Companies and Travel Decision Makers:
53% permit booking vacation rentals for business trips.
Business Travelers:
74% of business travelers say their companies allow booking vacation rentals for work trips, indicating some misalignment between traveler and decision-maker expectations.

Off-Strip Activities for Your Next Team Offsite in Las Vegas
Vegas glitz? Yes! But escape the crowds at Fremont St., Neon Museum & Red Rock Canyon!
Kenny Totten
Las Vegas has so much to offer. And while the Strip is amazing, if you need to step away from the most popular tourist areas, we think these are three places you should check out.
Las Vegas is like an adult Disney World.
Everything you can imagine, directly at your fingertips.
But this dessert paradise can weigh on you. Talk to travelers who frequently visit Las Vegas, and they may echo the all too common phrase,
3-4 days in Vegas is enough.
There is truth to the conventional wisdom that Las Vegas is best enjoyed in short bursts. One of the more odd things that can happen in Tinsel Town is it becomes very easy to go days without seeing the sun.
In that spirit, we ve put together 3 fun ideas that get you outside, and off the Strip. As a bonus, these ideas are perfect for corporate groups  so put them in contention for your next team offsite.
Our first recommendation is a little on the wild side, so if you re an adrenaline junkie this is a total blast. Rent a dune buggy to drift around the Mojave Desert. There are multiple places you can rent buggies from but we went with Sunbuggy Las Vegas and did not regret it!
The staff was wonderful and whether you re a dune buggy enthusiast or a first timer we promise you ll have a truly awesome Vegas experience. The best part is you can have up to 200 people enjoy the ride simultaneously, TWO HUNDRED how awesome is that?
No one has to wait by the wayside on this team activity. The day before our desert adventure, Sunbuggy hosted 150 attendees for a corporate offsite. You can choose to be a driver or just be a passenger and enjoy the desert views. Even though we were having our Fast & Furious moment, everything felt super safe the entire time. It is such a unique and fun experience for everyone.
Now let s mention an activity just as compelling but doesn t involve the desert heat. This gem is called Omega Mart and it s right off the strip in a well known building labeled in gigantic letters, Area 15. Omega Mart is an interactive, mind-boggling, immersive art experience.
It s created by Meow Wolf, an arts and entertainment company focused on conceptualizing gigantic art installations that feel like you ve been transported to a whimsical realm. You and your entire team can enjoy this cool  museum  of sorts seven days a week and it s open until midnight every night! Highly recommend Omega Mart as a fun, inspired activity for your group to see a different side of Vegas.
There s a very special place in Sin City you don t hear about as often. It s where Las Vegas truly all began, and you can feel it. Ah, yes, the historic and forever iconic Fremont Street. Teeming with life and street entertainment this stretch looks nothing like the strip. It feels like you ve stepped into the fusion of Las Vegas and New Orleans.
No matter what time of day you go you ll be able to experience the  Mardi Gras'' of it all. If you just look up you ll see the largest video screen in the world. Not an exaggeration, it really is, and it spans larger than a football field. The screen illuminates Fremont Street twenty four hours a day, seven days a week with LED thunderstorms or galactic scenery firing above.
If you re feeling brave, there is a zipline that ll send you flying underneath the glowing canopy through the street with a pretty awesome view of the vivacious hustle and bustle below. Fremont Street is an underrated part of Vegas.
If you re looking to leave the fancy steak dinners behind for a night, try a stroll through Fremont Street to get the ole fashioned authentic Vegas experience.
Well there you have it! Three awesome, non generic things to do with your team in beautiful, lively Las Vegas. Business travelers from all over the globe flock to Vegas each year, most likely experiencing the city in the  googleable  ways.
So follow our advice and do something unique with your group, cover all the bases. One to get your blood pumping, one to get your mind bending, and one that ll top it all off and show everyone where Vegas really began.

Planning Your Corporate Offsite in Honolulu
Revitalize your corporate offsite with House of Savon in Honolulu.
Molly Lombardo
Let's face it, traditional corporate offsites can feel stale. The stuffy conference room, the same old presentations, and forced team-building exercises rarely spark creativity or connection.
But what if you could whisk your team away to a place that fosters productivity, connection, and inspiration? Welcome to Honolulu, and enter House of Savon: your one-stop shop for an unforgettable corporate offsite event.
House of Savon: Where Business Meets Aloha
House of Savon isn't your average co-working space. They understand the power of in-person connection and are dedicated to making your offsite memorable and productive.
Their shared workspace offers various membership tiers, perfect for accommodating your team's needs. Whether you have remote workers, aspiring female entrepreneurs, or a mix of both, SAVON has the space and resources to keep everyone comfortable and focused.
Destination Management: Crafting Unforgettable Experiences
Gone are the days of generic offsite events. Destination management services can help you tailor your offsite to a specific location, creating a truly unique experience for your team. Picture inspiring keynote speakers in stunning outdoor venues, or pop-up events that immerse your team in the local culture.
These memorable moments solidify bonds and create a shared narrative that strengthens your team identity.
Examples of Offsite Activities to Boost Productivity
Creative Problem-Solving:
Challenge your team with a design thinking workshop in a scenic location.
Volunteering Together:
Give back to the community while fostering collaboration with a local volunteer project.
Adventure Awaits:
Bond over a shared experience with an outdoor activity like hiking, kayaking, or whitewater rafting.
Cultural Immersion:
Learn about the local history and traditions through interactive workshops or guided tours.
AllFly: Streamlining Your Offsite Travel
Seamless Booking Platform:
Forget endless back-and-forth emails. AllFly's user-friendly platform allows your team to search, compare, and book flights easily.

AllFly understands that plans can change. Their platform allows for easy modifications and keeps you informed of any schedule updates.
24/7 Support:
Travel hiccups happen. AllFly's dedicated customer service team is available around the clock to ensure your team has a stress-free travel experience.
Crafting Your Dream Offsite
Here's a glimpse into what your Honolulu offsite with House of Savon
Morning:
Welcome your guest with coffee and a continental breakfast from our neighborhood grocery store and Starbucks as uplifting music plays on our overhead Bose house speakers. When it s time to start the meeting, invite your guest to take their seats using our wireless mics as they face our 85  tv for your powerpoint presentation.
Mid-morning:
During break, your guests have the opportunity to sit outside in our luscious green courtyard and enjoy the fresh breeze and Hawaii sun.
Afternoon:
For lunch, you can either cater from any local restaurant or your guest can take a lunch break at any of our nearby restaurants just a short 5 min walk from our space.
Evening:
Celebrate your team accomplishments with a Pau Hana (happy hour) as you watch the sun set behind the iconic Diamond Head from the comfort of our venue.
Aloha Means Welcome
House of Savon's philosophy aligns perfectly with the spirit of Aloha   a sense of mutual respect, understanding, and hospitality.
Let them help you create a corporate offsite that fosters connection, ignites creativity, and leaves your team feeling valued and inspired. And with AllFly taking care of airfare, you can focus on what truly matters: creating a memorable experience for your team.

Quest: One-Stop for Corporate Event & Everyday Travel Booking
AllFly is now your one-stop-shop for all of your company's travel needs. Book individual flights, hotels, cars, and events in a single platform.
Kenny Totten
Remember the glory days of corporate travel? Sales reps clocking in miles like frequent flyer gods, conquering territories with every new handshake. Expense reports overflowing with receipts from airport lounges and five-star hotels.
Ah, the early 2000s   a simpler time for travel programs.
Fast forward to 2024. Zoom fatigue is real, and the lone wolf salesman is a relic of the past. But while individual business travel may have taken a backseat, teamwork still fuels success.
In this brave new world, team offsites and strategic events have become the cornerstones of building a thriving company culture. In fact, for many of our accounts, event travel accounts for more than 50% of a company s total travel budget.
But here's the rub: legacy travel platforms are stuck in the pre-pandemic era and not built for a world where 50% of travel spend is allocated for event & meeting travel.
They're still chasing ghosts of road warriors, ignoring the rise of the collaborative travel experience. Booking a company incentive trip feels like wrestling a dinosaur to the ground. The truth is, the way companies travel today has changed, but many of the legacy online booking tools have not.
(We are looking at you, Concur)
That's where AllFly Quest enters the scene. We're not your grandpa's travel platform. We're built for the modern era of group travel, where every journey is a shared adventure. Quest empowers you to:
Go beyond everyday business travel: Give your employees access to the best deals on flights, hotels, and cars for both individual trips and company excursions.
Unleash the power of events: Plan, book, and manage offsites, conferences, and incentive trips with ease. We've got dedicated tools for event-level reporting (goodbye, arrival/departure spreadsheets!), split pay options for travel upgrades, and even a Ticket Protection Plan for unexpected cancellations.
Simplify the madness: Ditch the travel agency ping pong. Quest puts everything at your fingertips   from budget management to post-trip reconciliation. No more chasing invoices or deciphering expense reports.
Born from the trenches of group travel: AllFly didn't just parachute into this landscape. We started booking airfare for events years ago, witnessing firsthand the struggles of companies yearning for a seamless solution. Quest is built on the insights of hundreds of programs, crafted for the specific needs of meeting planners and travel managers like you.
So, the next time you dream of an epic team offsite or a mind-blowing conference, stop the spreadsheet torture. AllFly Quest is here to take the wheel. Let's navigate the new era of group travel together, where collaboration knows no borders and adventures await around every corner.
Ready to ditch the dinosaur and embrace the future? Visit our website and discover how AllFly Quest can elevate your travel program to new heights.
Remember, the road warriors may be gone, but the road to incredible company experiences is wide open.
Let's hit the gas!

Second-Tier Cities Soar for Offsites and Corporate Travel
Corporate travel is shifting towards second-tier cities which offer unique experiences, lower costs, and modern amenities for business events.
Molly Lombardo
Here at AllFly, we're seeing a major shift in the world of corporate travel: second-tier cities are taking flight as prime destinations for offsites, incentives, and corporate bookings.
Clients are increasingly looking beyond the usual suspects, choosing exciting locations like Jacksonville, Florida, and Phoenix, Arizona, to host their meetings and gatherings.
This trend aligns with a recent
Skift article
, highlighting a surge in event bookings for unexpected locations.
Second Cities Take Center Stage
Forget the traditional business hubs! Cities once considered off the beaten path are now experiencing a boom in corporate events.
Louisville, Kentucky; Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Greensboro-Winston Salem, North Carolina, are leading the pack with a staggering year-over-year growth exceeding 65%!
This rise is attributed to a mix of factors, including interest from national and state associations, along with specific industries like manufacturing and education.
Even mid-sized markets like South Wisconsin and Myrtle Beach are seeing significant growth, suggesting a broader trend.
First-Tier Cities Still in Play
While second-tier cities are experiencing a surge, established destinations like Tampa-St. Petersburg, Denver, and Boston remain popular for corporate bookings. These locations continue to attract major events hosted by national associations, technology groups, healthcare providers, and tech companies.
Industry Shifts on the Horizon
The data also reveals some intriguing shifts within specific industries. While Tampa-St. Petersburg saw modest growth overall, February showed a significant increase in events for environmental services, agriculture, data/research, and marketing/advertising   all experiencing over 200% year-over-year growth. This suggests a potential diversification within the meetings and events sector.
Sunshine Still Shines Bright
Despite some travel advisories, Tampa-St. Petersburg's success demonstrates their resilience. The city attributes its continued growth to a dedicated team, a convention center expansion, and a welcoming approach to business travelers.
The Final Boarding Call
The landscape of corporate travel for offsite events and incentive trips is changing. Second-tier cities offer unique experiences, competitive rates, and modern facilities, making them serious contenders for your next event. While established destinations remain relevant, there's a clear trend towards diversification.
So, the next time you're planning a corporate event, consider venturing beyond the usual suspects and explore the hidden gems that second-tier cities have to offer! You might be surprised by what you find.

Refundable vs. Non-Refundable Flights
When booking flights, travelers often debate between refundable and non-refundable fares.
Molly Lombardo
When it comes to booking airline tickets, one common dilemma many travelers face is whether to opt for refundable fares.
At AllFly, we often receive questions about the pros and cons of these ticket options. In this post, we'll break down the cost implications to help you make an informed decision.
Understanding Refundable Fares
Refundable fares are marketed as offering flexibility, allowing travelers to cancel their bookings and receive a refund directly to the original form of payment.
However, the reality is slightly different. Non-refundable fares, when canceled, typically result in the value of the ticket being returned as an e-credit to the traveler's individual profile, rather than being refunded to the original payment method.
Refundable tickets, on the other hand, do provide the advantage of refunding the money back to the card it was purchased on.
This convenience, however, comes with a higher price tag, as refundable tickets are generally more expensive than non-refundable ones.
The Cost-Benefit Analysis
Let's consider an example to illustrate the cost implications of choosing between refundable and non-refundable fares.
See below a $600 ticket from Orlando to Cancun, with a refundable ticket for the same flight costing an $85 markup. If your corporate program has an average cancellation rate of 4%, or 2 out of 50 passengers canceling their tickets, the math becomes clearer.
If you opt for all non-refundable tickets with an average upcharge of $85 per ticket, you would spend $4,250 more on airfare.
However, if two people cancel and you lose the value of their $600 tickets, the company is only out $1,200.
The travelers will receive the value of the ticket as an e-credit on their profile, which is not transferable to the company.
The Verdict
In most situations, it is often more cost-effective for companies to "roll the dice" and accept the risk of canceled tickets rather than spending more on refundable fares to protect themselves.

Rebranding to AllFly
We have rebranded from Bacarai to AllFly, ushering in a new phase for building a better future for group air travel.
Kenny Totten
A few years ago, we made a mistake.
Have you ever made a decision, thought it was good in the moment, and later came to regret it?
Yea, us too.
We named our company Bacarai.
Is it a rum company, or an online gambling site?
Who knows! No one knows. And it was a distraction that wasn t doing us any favors.
So rather than row endlessly on the ship they call regret, we wanted to take the opportunity with our new funding to chart a new course and rebrand the company.
At our core, the mission remains the same  make group air travel easier to plan, book, and manage. So much of group air travel happens offline, whether you are a student group of 60 passengers flying to Orlando for a school trip, or a business embarking on your first team offsite, group air travel is far from easy.
After years of people mis-spelling, mis-pronouncing, and people calling us Bacardi (you know, the rum company), we opted for something more true to what we do.
Enter AllFly.
Bacarai is rebranding to AllFly. Here is the new logo.
I think the name says it all   the AllFly name honors the mission and highlights the focus on group air travel. The icon is a ticket, which is symbolic of jumping on a flight. Industry insiders will be quick to point out that paper tickets will eventually die, and we are okay with that.
To us, the ticket symbol is a small tether to the
 old school 
  a homage to how much of the travel industry is stuck in the past. And for whatever reason, a paper ticket reminds me of when travel used to be more luxurious, and the service used to always be first class.
I think the ticket is the right way to remind ourselves that as much as we layer technology to group air travel, a great experience always starts and stops with service. The ticket is our reminder that  going old-school  is the way to earn and keep business.
Call us old-fashion, but we like opening car doors for our dates, saying please and thank you, and going the extra mile for our customers. The ticket is our commitment to the old way, to making people smile with superior service.
You ll see a whole new refined visual identity as well. One that is cleaner, with a touch of fun.
You may be thinking, what s the story behind Bacarai? How did that name happen?
Well, if you see us at an event or conference, you ll have to buy us a beer (or shot of rum) for us to turn that leaf over again.
Onward and upwards.
Safe travels.

The 7 Most Common Questions Answered by Our Chatbot, Alice
Get quick answers to common corporate travel questions with AllFly's chatbot, Alice, from deposits to cancellations and 24/7 support.
Molly Lombardo
At AllFly, we understand that navigating corporate travel can come with many questions. That s why we ve equipped our platform with Alice, our intelligent chatbot designed to provide quick and accurate answers to your most pressing travel inquiries.
Below, we ve compiled the seven most common questions our customers ask Alice, along with her detailed responses.
1. How Do Deposits Work with AllFly?
Alice s Answer:
At AllFly, we collect a per-passenger deposit before the trip, which acts as a flight credit to begin the booking process. The deposit amount varies depending on the destination:
Domestic (US, Canada, & Inter-Europe):
$350
Central America & the Caribbean:
$500
International:
$1,200
These amounts may be adjusted based on market conditions, but rest assured, AllFly will inform you of any changes before collecting the deposit. This deposit system simplifies the billing process for event travel, eliminating the need for employees to use their individual cards and submit for reimbursements later. Once the travel is completed, AllFly issues a final invoice that reflects the total airfare cost minus the deposit paid, plus any ticketing fees.
If the deposit exceeds the total travel cost, AllFly will refund the surplus within 30 days post-travel. Conversely, if travel costs exceed the deposit by more than $5,000, we may request an additional deposit to cover the difference.
2. How Do I Cancel or Change My Flight with AllFly?
Alice s Answer:
If you need to cancel or change your flight with AllFly, you have several options:
For Cancellations:
Email us at travelops@allfly.io
Use the chatbot in the support tab of Quest
Have your confirmation number, travel dates, and times ready
For Changes:
For non-urgent changes (24-48 hours), email travelops@allfly.io
For immediate assistance, call +1-407-362-1882
Use the Support page in Quest's left-hand menu
For both cancellations and changes, you can also contact an account manager at +1-407-362-1882. They can assist with changing reservations, canceling reservations, and updating personal information. For simple seat changes on the same flight, it s often easiest to do so directly on the airline s website.
3. Can I Pre-Purchase My Bags While Booking on AllFly?
Alice s Answer:
No, you cannot prepay for baggage during the booking process on AllFly. However, you can do so later through the airline s website or app during online check-in.
4. Are the Flights Cheaper on Google Flights?
Alice s Answer:
Flights on Google Flights may sometimes appear cheaper, but they often don't reflect the true cost for corporate travel. Google Flights typically displays Basic Economy prices, which are usually $50 to $100 less than standard Economy fares.
Most business travelers fly in standard economy, which typically costs $60-$150 more than the basic economy fares shown on Google Flights.
For more accurate pricing, especially for corporate travel, it s recommended to use AllFly s
Forecast
tool, which provides more reliable estimates for budgeting purposes.
5. Does AllFly Have 24/7 Support?
Alice s Answer:
Yes, AllFly offers 24/7 customer support to ensure assistance is always available when you need it. Our round-the-clock support is designed to address any travel-related issues that may arise at any time.
AllFly provides multiple channels for accessing this 24/7 support:
Chatbot:
For instant self-service solutions, with the option to connect to a human agent if needed.
Phone:
Available for urgent issues requiring immediate attention.
Email:
For non-urgent inquiries, with responses typically within 24 hours.
Video Chat:
For complex situations that may require screen sharing.
Additionally, AllFly aims to respond to support requests within 4 hours during normal business hours and within 48 hours outside of normal business hours. However, during high-demand periods or mass events, response times may be longer, but AllFly will proactively communicate any expected delays.
6. Can AllFly Book Refundable Fares?
Alice s Answer:
Yes, AllFly can book refundable fares, but not through the Quest platform. The Quest platform only allows users to select non-refundable fares. If you need to purchase a refundable ticket, you ll need to contact a member of the AllFly team directly.
To book a refundable fare, you can reach out to AllFly via:
Email: travelops@allfly.io
Phone: (855) 205-4905
When contacting the team to make a reservation, please have all relevant information ready. It s important to note that refundable fares typically come at a higher cost compared to non-refundable fares. However, they offer more flexibility, as the refund goes back to the original form of payment if canceled.
7. Can I Use Airline Miles to Book Travel with AllFly?
Alice s Answer:
No, unfortunately, you cannot book travel through Quest using airline miles. However, you can enter your frequent flyer account information to receive miles when booking through Quest.
We hope these answers from Alice help clarify some of the most common questions about using AllFly. For any additional inquiries or further assistance, Alice is always here to help, ensuring your corporate travel experience is as smooth and efficient as possible.

The Carry-On Battle: Airlines Tighten Rules, Raise Fees
Airlines crack down on carry-ons! Pack smarter or face fees
Molly Lombardo
Wall Street Journal
recently pointed out a lesser-known battleground between airlines and passengers: carry-on luggage.
While checked bag fees often dominate headlines, the items you bring onboard are becoming a focal point for airlines looking to streamline operations and increase revenue.
Other major airlines such as Delta, United, and American have quietly adopted Southwest Airlines' move to reclassify pillows and blankets as personal items.
This shift means passengers may need to rethink what they pack and how they pack it, as airlines tighten regulations on what qualifies as a carry-on or personal item.
For savvy travelers, this trend is a reminder to review and potentially repack their bags. With Delta's recent announcement of increased checked-bag fees   now $35 for the first bag and $45 for the second   and other airlines following suit, it's clear that the days of avoiding baggage fees are becoming more challenging.
American Airlines has also joined the trend, with adjustments to their baggage fees and a new discount for slightly overweight bags.
Similarly, United, JetBlue, and Alaska Airlines have introduced $5 increases on bag fees, reflecting the industry's response to rising operational costs and fluctuating airfare prices.
Despite these changes, Southwest remains unique in its offering of two free checked bags, although the airline has also tightened regulations on additional carry-ons.
As airlines become more strict about extra items passengers try to bring onboard, it's clear that the days of slipping by with a fanny pack or shopping bag are coming to an end.
This shift underscores the importance for travelers to stay informed and adaptable in their packing strategies. Packing light and packing smart are no longer just suggestions but essential practices in navigating the evolving landscape of airline regulations and fees

The Airline Ticket Sales Shift: Navigating Distribution Wars
The move from EDIFACT to NDC technology is reshaping the travel industry and challenging established players
Kenny Totten
In recent years, the airline industry has been pushing for a major transformation in the way fares are sold and distributed.
This transformation means billions of dollars of revenue is up for grabs.
(Grab your popcorn, because it's going to be a showdown).
If you are new to travel, the industry runs on a technology that was invented in the early 70 s. In order to keep up with modern times, there has been a push to modernize the underlying technology.
You can think of the transition like moving from using a corded landline to make a phone call to FaceTiming your grandmother in an iPhone 14 in 4K.
There are many players who power the airline industry. For the purpose of this blog article, we are going to focus on two groups of opposing sides.
The airlines versus the GDS (Sabre & Amadeus).
The shift from traditional EDIFACT technology to the newer NDC (New Distribution Capability) has created a stir in the travel world, with far-reaching implications for airlines, travel agencies, and technology providers.
In this blog post, we will explore the background of this brewing distribution war, examine the key players, and assess the potential winners and losers in this rapidly evolving landscape.
EDIFACT and the Role of Sabre and Amadeus in the Travel World
EDIFACT (Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport) is a standardized message format used for communication between businesses across multiple industries, including travel.
For decades, EDIFACT has been the backbone of the Global Distribution Systems (GDS), which connects airlines, hotels, car rental companies, and other travel suppliers with travel agencies and end consumers.
Sabre and Amadeus are two of the leading GDS providers in the travel industry, responsible for aggregating and distributing content from airlines and other suppliers to travel agencies and other resellers.
By controlling the flow of information and booking capabilities, they have held considerable power and influence over fare distribution and sales.
This is all a fight over $3-$12 dollars
While the specific fees charged by GDS providers like Sabre and Amadeus may vary based on multiple factors, including the airline, booking volume, and negotiated agreements, we can provide some general estimates on their earnings when a traveler books through an EDIFACT-powered channel like Expedia or Orbitz:
On average, GDS providers like Sabre and Amadeus may charge airlines between $3 and $12 per flight segment booked through their systems.
This means that if a traveler books a round-trip flight consisting of two segments, the GDS provider might earn anywhere from $6 to $24 for that particular booking.
It's important to note that these fees are paid by the airlines, not the end consumers.
These fees can add up quickly when considering the millions of flight segments booked through GDS providers each year. For instance, in 2019, Amadeus reported over $631 million bookings made through its GDS, translating into significant revenue for the company.
Additionally, GDS providers may also charge other travel suppliers, such as hotels and car rental companies, for the distribution of their content through the system. These fees may vary based on the supplier, booking volume, and negotiated contracts.
In summary, while the exact amounts can vary, Sabre and Amadeus earn significant revenue from the fees they charge airlines and other travel suppliers for bookings made through their EDIFACT-powered channels.
This is a key reason why the shift towards NDC, which could reduce or bypass these fees, has the potential to significantly impact their business models.
The Rise of NDC and its Appeal to Airlines
NDC (New Distribution Capability) is a travel industry-supported XML-based data transmission standard introduced by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).
NDC allows airlines to offer richer content and a more personalized shopping experience by directly connecting them with travel agencies and other distribution partners.
Airlines prefer NDC for several reasons:
Cost savings: NDC enables airlines to bypass the fees charged by GDS providers, reducing distribution costs.
Control over content: With NDC, airlines have greater control over their offerings, allowing them to customize and bundle products and services more effectively.
Enhanced customer experience: NDC allows for a more tailored shopping experience, with personalized offers based on customer preferences and travel history.
Winners and Losers in the NDC Transition
The shift toward NDC has the potential to benefit and harm various stakeholders in the travel industry:
Winners: Airlines stand to gain the most from the adoption of NDC, as they will enjoy cost savings, greater control over content, and the ability to offer personalized experiences to customers. Innovative travel agencies and technology companies that quickly adopt and leverage NDC capabilities can also benefit by staying ahead of the competition.
Losers: GDS providers like Sabre and Amadeus may see their market share and influence diminish as airlines bypass their systems in favor of NDC.
Up in the air: Traditional travel agencies that rely heavily on GDS and fail to adapt to the new technology may also struggle to remain competitive. Legacy online booking platforms will suffer. The newer, more resourced platforms will provide better content, lower prices, and a better shopping experience.
Conclusion
As the airline industry moves toward widespread adoption of NDC, the travel distribution landscape is set for a major shake-up. With the potential for cost savings and increased control over content, airlines are eager to embrace this new technology.
However, the shift also poses challenges for established players like Sabre and Amadeus, as well as travel agencies that are slow to adapt.
Ultimately, those who can successfully navigate this brewing distribution war will be best positioned to thrive in the new era of airline ticket sales.

The Bleisure Trip is Here to Stay
Scores of people are now extending their work trips into vacations.
Kenny Totten
The trend of corporate travelers turning their work trips into leisure trips, also known as "bleisure" travel, has been on the rise in recent years. Over the past year, we've noticed a strong uptick in this trend. Often, the frequency in which people upgrade depends on the destination. For example, we recently booked a corporate meeting to Hawaii where over half the attendees extended their trip.
According to a study by BridgeStreet Global Hospitality, nearly two-thirds of business travelers have added leisure time to their work trips in the past year.
Without a doubt, the rise of bleisure travel goes hand in hand with the explosion of remote work. With more people working remotely, there is less pressure to return home immediately after a work trip and more flexibility to extend the trip for personal travel. Additionally, many people are using the opportunity to combine work and leisure travel to save on vacation days and get more out of their trips.
Another reason for the trend is the changing attitudes towards work-life balance. Many people now prioritize their mental and physical well-being, and view bleisure travel as a way to recharge and return to work refreshed and energized. Furthermore, many companies are now also recognizing the benefits of bleisure travel for their employees and are even encouraging it as a way to improve employee satisfaction and retention.
For AllFly, this trend presents a great opportunity to drive value for our customers. Inside of our product, we've built features that allow the company and their attendees the ability to green light extending their trip. For example, inside of AllFly Meetings, you can now upgrade your seat to first class and have the attendees pay the difference between the first class ticket and the main cabin fare.
We also can bill the attendee the difference if there is a considerable delta in their return fare changing. For example, say the attendees' meeting ended on Sunday, and that was supposed to be their departure date-- the Sunday ticket cost $400. However, the attendees wanted to extend their trip and go home on Tuesday, which caused the ticket to go up to $550. Our system allows the company to be billed the original amount while the traveler pays the difference.
Overall, bleisure travel is a growing trend that offers a win-win situation for both travelers and travel agencies. By combining work and leisure travel, travelers can save on vacation days and return to work refreshed and energized, while travel agencies can increase revenue and provide a more comprehensive travel experience for their clients.
By understanding the logistics and offering appropriate packages, travel agencies can capitalize on this trend and offer bleisure travel as a great option to their clients.

The Perfect Mid-Size Corporate Offsite in Beaufort, North Carolina
Beaufort and the NC coast offer a laid-back setting for a unique, affordable team offsite.
Molly Lombardo
Hi there! I'm Molly, the Marketing Manager at AllFy, and I have a passion for exploring quaint coastal towns with charming architecture, dive bars, and friendly people.
While many opt for big cities, I've found my heart in places like Beaufort, North Carolina   a hidden gem that offers a unique and refreshing corporate offsite experience.
Getting There
Sure, Beaufort may not have its own airport, but the journey is part of the adventure.
Flying into New Bern Airport, just 32.9 miles away, gives you a taste of the picturesque town featured in The Notebook.
Take a stroll down cobblestone streets under 100-year-old live oak trees and soak in the historic charm before starting your offsite journey.
Team Meal Kickoff
Before reaching Beaufort, stop by
Persimmons
in New Bern for a delightful team meal. Overlooking the Neuse River, Chef David crafts culinary wonders blending his North Carolina roots with fresh ingredients and exciting flavors. My favorite is the 4-course tequila dinner. It is a unique experience that sets the tone for a weekend filled with culinary delights.
Beaufort Hotel
A 45-minute bus ride later, you'll find yourselves in Beaufort, ready to check in at the Beaufort Hotel   my personal favorite. With the best brunch in town, waterfront views from the dock, and a happy hour wine tasting, it's the perfect base for your corporate escape.
Beaufort Hotel Highlights:
Brunch with a view.
Dockside relaxation
Happy hour wine tasting
Bike Rentals
Team Bonding and Exploration
Downtime at the hotel offers opportunities for poolside relaxation, bike rides, and exploration of Beaufort's nightlife. An evening oyster roast with Local Seafood Catering and live music is a fantastic way to immerse your team in North Carolina's culture.
Ocracoke Island Adventure
 
The following day, your team can choose their own adventure   a private boat charter, downtown shopping, or a day at Atlantic Beach. A unique aspect of Beaufort is its proximity to Ocracoke, a special island town in the Outer Banks. With British accents and the charm of a bygone era, it's a true escape from the ordinary.
Dinner with a View
Cap off your team's busy day with dinner at
Moonrakers,
within walking distance of the hotel. Picture this: enjoying a delicious crab cake while watching wild horses roam   a dining experience like no other.
My Final Takeaway
Beaufort and the North Carolina coast offer a wholesome and laid-back environment, providing the perfect backdrop for a team offsite that's both unique and affordable. As much as I'd love to keep this charming town a secret, the allure of Beaufort makes it an ideal spot for a corporate getaway that breaks free from the conventional.
So, when planning your next corporate offsite, consider thinking outside the box and exploring a small town. Beaufort's charm, tranquility, and authenticity create an unforgettable experience that your team will cherish. Here's to discovering hidden gems and creating lasting memories beyond the typical corporate setting!
Happy Travels
XOXO

The Importance of Corporate Travel Policies
A good travel policy benefits the company and employees by managing costs, ensuring compliance, and prioritizing safety.
Molly Lombardo
As business travel rebounds from three lean years, companies are navigating a challenging cost environment. The prevalence of remote work over the past two years has reshaped the landscape of business trips, emphasizing the importance of corporate all-hands meetings and offsite gatherings.
However, this resurgence in travel comes amid a 25% increase in airline ticket prices, surpassing inflation rates. In light of these developments, it becomes increasingly vital to establish clear expectations and policies with your team.
Today, we'll delve into the benefits of implementing a corporate travel policy for your business and provide a useful template to kickstart the process. Keep reading, or simply download our business travel policy template to begin crafting your own.
Benefits for the Company:
Managing Costs
: A travel policy sets rules for expenses, helping to control costs effectively. By setting spending limits and preferred vendors, unnecessary spending is reduced, and better deals can be negotiated.
Ensuring Compliance and Reducing Risk
s: A travel policy helps to lower the chances of fraud or rule-breaking during business trips, giving clear guidelines for solving any problems that come up.
Employee Safety:
Including rules for travel insurance, emergency contacts, and backup plans makes sure that employees are taken care of, keeping their safety a priority.
Making Things Easier:
Clear procedures for booking, getting reimbursed, and getting approval simplify the paperwork and save time for everyone involved in business travel.
Benefits for Employees:
Duty of Care:
Demonstrating a commitment to employee safety and security through measures such as trip insurance and emergency contacts instills confidence in employees, enabling them to represent the organization effectively.
Task Simplification:
Transparent booking and reimbursement procedures eliminate confusion, enabling employees to understand expectations clearly and focus on their responsibilities without squandering time or resources.
Possible Rigidity
: If rules are too strict, employees might feel stuck and unhappy. Making sure policies give freedom while also protecting the team and investments can help fix this.
Consistent Travel
: A well-structured travel policy establishes guidelines for accommodations, transportation, and other travel arrangements, ensuring a uniform and pleasant experience for all team members.
Limited Personalization:
One-size-fits-all policies may not meet everyone's needs. Adding rules for special cases with approval can help with this.
Creating a Corporate Travel Policy:
Creating a travel policy may seem daunting, but it's essential for mitigating potential challenges while ensuring the well-being of both the company and its employees.
Finding the right balance between rules and flexibility is important.

The Power of Corporate Retreats and Offsites
Boosting Leadership, Teamwork, and Morale
Molly Lombardo
In the fast-paced and competitive business landscape, companies are constantly looking for innovative methods to boost leadership, teamwork, and employee morale. One effective strategy that has gained popularity is the use of corporate retreats and offsites.
Understanding Company Offsites and Corporate Retreats
A corporate retreat, also referred to as a business retreat, is a dedicated period for employees within a company. These retreats are designed to boost team morale and engagement while aligning with the organization's overall goals.
These planned business events are often conducted off-site to promote team building, training, and relaxation, away from the usual work environment.
In contrast, corporate offsites unite employees outside the office for a shared and memorable experience, which can take place in natural settings, distant cities, or local hotels near the usual place of business.
Activities typically include social gatherings, creative workshops, and team-building exercises.
Distinguishing Between Company Offsites and Corporate Retreats
Team-building offsites typically include a mix of non-core business activities and are less formal, often allowing for family participation, including spouses and children. These offsites are often held in locations that offer a variety of team-building activities to promote trust and unity among team members.
In contrast, corporate retreats emphasize the company's operational and business objectives. They are usually held in cities where the company has a physical presence or in environments with convenient travel and accessible meeting spaces. Corporate retreats prioritize professional development and operational strategies, and family members are typically not invited.
Impact of Corporate Offsites and Retreats on Company Success
Increased Productivity
: Off-site meetings are often seen as more productive than in-office meetings, leading to better outcomes and increased engagement among participants. For example, a marketing team might have a brainstorming session at a picturesque retreat center, leading to innovative campaign ideas.
Building Trust:
These events help teams form solid bonds and relationships, essential for effective collaboration and progress. For instance, a team-building activity like a trust fall exercise can help colleagues trust each other more.
Improved Communication:
Offsites can enhance communication among team members, addressing common issues in today's corporate world, such as lack of professional communication standards. For example, a communication workshop during a retreat can help team members understand different communication styles.
Identifying Skills
: Retreats allow employees to showcase their hidden talents and abilities, providing insights for employers and managers to nurture these skills. For instance, a team-building challenge might reveal that a quiet employee is an excellent leader.
Preventing Burnout:
Corporate getaways provide a break from routine work, reducing stress and preventing burnout among employees. For example, a company might organize a retreat at a spa resort to help employees relax and recharge.
Boosting Company's Brand
: Team retreats can enhance the company's brand by positioning it as an attractive employer and innovative organization, thus attracting and retaining top talent. For example, sharing photos and experiences from a retreat on social media can showcase the company's positive culture and values.
In conclusion, corporate retreats and offsites play a crucial role in building a vibrant and energetic workplace. By investing in these programs, businesses can improve leadership, teamwork, and employee morale, ultimately contributing to their overall success.

The Perfect Time to Book a Domestic Flight
Two people can sit next to one another on a plane and pay wildly different prices. If you want to save money on flights, here is how.
Kenny Totten
Two people can sit next to one another on a plane and pay wildly different prices. If you want to save money on flights, here is how.
There are a lot of variables that go into finding the perfect time to book a domestic flight. Airfare prices are constantly changing, and it can be difficult to know when to purchase your ticket. However, there are a few tips and tricks that you can use to help you save money on your next flight. Keep reading to find out more!
When to Buy
The best time to buy a domestic flight is usually between four and six weeks before your trip. During this time period, airlines typically release their schedules for the upcoming months and start to offer discounts on tickets. If you can be flexible with your travel dates, this is the best time to book your flight.
If you're not able to book your flight during this window, don't worry! You can still find deals by booking your flight on a Tuesday or Wednesday. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are typically the cheapest days to fly, so you may be able to find a cheaper ticket if you're willing to fly on one of these days.
When Not to Buy
You should avoid booking your flight too far in advance or too close to your travel dates. If you book too far in advance, you run the risk of the airline changing its schedule or increasing prices. If you wait too long to book, there may not be any seats left on the plane!
The best time to buy a domestic flight is usually between four and six weeks before your trip. However, if you're not able to book during this window, don't worry! You can still find deals by booking your flight on a Tuesday or Wednesday. Just make sure that you avoid booking your flight too far in advance or too close to your travel dates.
 
Happy travels!

The Ultimate Guide to Working Remotely While Traveling
Remote work lets you travel while earning but has challenges like employer approval and staying productive
Molly Lombardo
The opportunities for combining travel and work have never been so clear. But despite more companies and freelancers embracing the possibilities, this style of working (and traveling) isn t without its challenges. Here s a complete guide on how to work remotely and travel.
Benefits of Remote Work Trips
1. Enjoy Different Locations While Earning:
 
The obvious benefit is spending time in a different location while still earning your income as usual. It s a chance to break away from your typical routine and see the world without having to give up your career.
2. Work-Life Balance:
You can spend the day working from anywhere with WiFi, then spend your evenings and weekends exploring new places, engaging in outdoor activities, or simply relaxing. Smaller remote trips offer many advantages, such as making holidays easier to plan by combining work with leisure.
3. Flexibility and Freedom:
Combining remote work with regular holidays allows you to acclimate and work before fully diving into vacation mode. You can avoid peak tourist times, spend more time with loved ones abroad, and properly pursue hobbies (like kite-surfing daily).
Challenges of Remote Work and Travel
1. Employer Approval:
If you don t work for yourself, the first hurdle is getting approval from your employer. Some employers may restrict remote work to your home country due to legal or practical reasons. It s essential to discuss your plans and negotiate terms.
2. Maintaining Productivity:
Working remotely while traveling requires self-discipline and motivation. It can be challenging to focus on work when you re in an exciting destination. The desire to explore can interfere with productivity, leading to late-night work sessions.
Tips for Working from Anywhere
1
. Check Employer Policies:
Discuss with your employer about remote work possibilities. If you already work remotely in your home country, you re in a better position to negotiate terms for working abroad. Some companies may have informal policies allowing remote work from different locations.
2. Realistic Expectations:
Understand that remote work trips are different from vacations. Constantly moving can hinder productivity and drain energy. Staying in one place longer helps maintain a balance between work and travel.
The Rise of 'Bleisure' Travel
Remote work has blurred the line between business and personal travel. "Bleisure" travel, combining business and leisure, is becoming more popular. This trend allows remote workers to travel more freely, maximizing paid time off and exploring new destinations.
Changing Travel Patterns
Remote work is shifting traditional travel patterns. With flexible schedules, remote workers can travel during off-peak times, making flights more affordable and extending trips over busy holidays.
Industry Adaptations
The travel industry is adapting to the rise of remote work. Platforms like Airbnb report an increase in long-term stays, and companies are introducing flexible search functionalities for remote workers.
We've got the lowdown on the best cards for different types of travelers, so you can snag the perfect fit.

Web Traffic Hints Travel Demand to Stay Strong
A look into the web traffic of the major booking platforms shows despite a recessionary environment, travel demand remains high.
Kenny Totten
We ve all heard of the term  revenge travel  right? The wonderfully coined practice of traveling as a way of making up for lost time during the pandemic.
Travel is in high demand these days as people are taking back their freedom. We re all yearning for a little adventure after years of mandatory couch potato life. Now it s only natural for us to have residual COVID concerns or anxieties about the economy and inflation.
Yet after seeing a new report from top travel agencies on December s web traffic, you wouldn t know it.
As stated by Similarweb, a digital intelligence platform, TripAdvisor, Airbnb, Booking.com, and Expedia were delighted by heightened visitor traffic on a monthly and yearly basis. This paints 2023 as a promising year for the travel industry.
The boost for Booking.com was particularly hearty with a 28% increase in year-over-year traffic in December. Tripadvisor is the largest platform with ever growing popularity. The site s yearly visitor count was an astounding 89 million.
This is 15% higher than the previous year. Another competitor, Expedia saw roughly 17% growth with 67 million site visitors. This is the same amount of visitors Airbnb experienced. Although, they fell behind the others in year-over-year growth with a meager 6%.
Who knew a global pandemic could be so lucrative for the travel industry?
Kudos to Booking.com s impressive progression by gaining nearly two percentage points, more than any of its competitors.
Despite the changing traffic shares, Tripadvisor remained superior with 32% of the total share of traffic, followed by Expedia and Airbnb at 24% and Booking.com at 20%.
All four OTAs saw an average of 8% month-over-month growth in December with no signs of slowing down. Similarweb s senior insights manager, Jim Corridore, says  People are choosing experiences over other types of purchases with their discretionary income, and of those experiences they are choosing travel. 
Every corner of travel will be positively affected by this influx in consumer demand for experiences. Think cruises, car rentals, vacation rentals, airlines, etc.
After a couple of stagnant years, the industry deserves the decent growth we are seeing today. Revenge travel is all the rage. Who knew the word revenge would generate such prosperity?

Top Corporate Offsite Spots in New York City
At AllFly, we specialize in collaborating with meeting planners to handle air travel for meetings, events, and offsites.
Sarah Fearon
Hey everyone, Sarah here! I m a Sales Manager with AllFly as well as your unofficial guide to all things NYC and, of course, epic offsite adventures. So, you re planning your team s offsite and you ve decided on NYC (smart choice, I d bring the AllFly team here, too!). Wondering where to even begin in a city that never sleeps? Well, fear not. Here s an itinerary, plus some insider tips, that'll leave your team buzzing long after they've boarded that return flight.
1. Prep Like a Pro
Getting here: JFK is New York s largest (and busiest) airport and is the hub for international travel. LGA is the smallest of the NYC area s airports and the most popular for domestic travel. It s also the closest airport to Manhattan (and my personal favorite).
Pack smart: LAYERS, LAYERS, LAYERS. A spring trip to NYC could mean anything from a sudden snow flurry to sunny and 75 . Don t forget comfortable shoes! You ll be doing a
lot
of walking.
2. Work Hard, Play Harder
Cheers to the skyline: Just imagine  the sunset paints the cityscape in golden hues, you're perched on a private rooftop terrace, toasting to your achievements and your teammates. Midtown Terrace offers stunning views and exclusive rental options for unforgettable group experiences. The best part? The retractable enclosed rooftop means you can enjoy the terrace in any weather.
 
Rock and bowl: This Williamsburg hotspot combines vintage lanes with live music and a killer menu. Brooklyn Bowl is an effortlessly cool venue and the perfect way to bond with your colleagues, unleash your inner competitor, and have some serious fun.
The WaterTower: After you ve shown off your bowling skills, walk right across the street to The WaterTower. Located atop Arlo Williamsburg, this iconic NYC water tower has been transformed into a chic lounge with unobstructed views of the Manhattan skyline.
A breath of fresh air: After all that city buzz, recharge with a guided walking tour through the iconic Central Park. Discover hidden gems like the Ramble's winding paths, Belvedere Castle's stunning views, and the charming Shakespeare Garden. Then, kick back and relax with a gourmet picnic on the grass against the backdrop of the NYC skyline!
 
3. Bon Appetit
For a nice team dinner, Chinese Tuxedo is an absolute MUST. Nestled in the heart of Chinatown, the attention to decor and eclectic spins on Chinese food make this spot unforgettable. The food is
incredible
and served family style which makes this spot perfect for groups. Pro tip- check out the speakeasy bar downstairs after dinner!
Oh, you ve been blessed with a day of perfect weather in NYC? Run, don t walk, to this boat-turned-oyster bar that offers a taste of the Hamptons right in the heart of the city. Step aboard Grand Banks, docked at Tribeca Piers, and enjoy the sunset, some of the best oysters in town, and nautically inspired cocktails (or mocktails!).
No NYC offsite is complete without indulging in the city's most legendary dish   pizza!  a Take a pizza making class and learn the secrets of crafting the perfect New York-style pie from dough tossing to cheese selection. Pizza School in the Lower East Side offers interactive classes where you'll work together, laugh, and ultimately devour your masterpieces.
So, there you have it, folks! Your NYC offsite guide is ready. Now go forth, explore the city, and build some unforgettable memories with your team.
And hey, if you need a local guide to help navigate the Big Apple, you know who to call (wink wink).
Happy offsiting, everyone!
Sarah, your NYC Adventure Guru

Understanding Duty of Care in Business Travel and Why it s Important
Duty of Care is an essential aspect of business travel management that aligns with a company's commitment to the well-being and safety of its employees.
Lizzy Czyz
Corporate travel is a vital part of maintaining global connections and fostering growth for a business. As companies expand their reach, it's crucial to ensure the safety and well-being of employees on business trips. This is where the concept of "Duty of Care'' comes into play   a commitment to providing a secure and supportive environment for traveling employees.
What is Duty of Care?
Duty of Care refers to the legal and ethical obligation organizations have to protect their employees' health, safety, and well-being, particularly when they are traveling for work. This duty extends to all aspects of business travel, from the planning stage to the journey itself and the return home.
How to Implement Duty of Care in Business Travel:
Pre-Travel Prep: Before any travel plans, conduct a risk assessment of all destinations, taking into account factors such as political stability, health issues, and local security conditions.
Travel Policies: Develop a comprehensive set of travel policies that provide employees with clear guidance on safety protocols, expense management, and emergency procedures.
Communication and Support: Maintain regular communication with traveling employees and use secure communication platforms to stay connected with them.
Emergency Planning: Establish an emergency plan that outlines the necessary steps to be taken in the event of natural disasters, politics, or health emergencies.
Post-Travel: Conduct debriefing sessions with employees upon their return to gather any feedback and address concerns in order to continuously improve the company's Duty of Care initiatives.
Why is Duty of Care Important in Business Travel?
Employee Retention and Satisfaction: Demonstrating a commitment to employees' well-being fosters loyalty and job satisfaction, contributing to higher retention rates.
Legal Compliance: Fulfilling Duty of Care obligations ensures legal compliance and protects the company from potential legal issues related to employee safety.
Risk Mitigation: Proactive risk management through Duty of Care measures reduces the likelihood of incidents and minimizes the impact of unexpected events.
Employee Productivity: When employees feel secure during business travel, their focus is on work rather than worrying about their safety, leading to increased productivity.
To summarize, Duty of Care is an essential aspect of business travel management that aligns with a company's commitment to the well-being and safety of its employees. By implementing travel policies, communication strategies, and support systems, companies can create a positive and secure environment for their employees who travel for work.

What Makes Quest Special
Quest is an online booking platform reimagined for companies who often book meetings, events and incentive trips.
Kenny Totten
Let s be honest about something up front.
There are a lot of options out there in the market when it comes to B2B travel booking software. AllFly and BoomPop have partnered up to ensure executing your next team offsite goes off without a hitch.
When it comes to evaluating travel booking platforms, the 800 pound gorilla in the room is Concur.
If you are unfamiliar with Concur, it's your parent s corporate booking tool of yester-year. It features a user interface that makes Amazon look like a shiny new Mercedes Benz. If GenZ was describing Concur, they d likely say:
 It s giving yellow pages vibes. 
And while it's easy to point out what s where legacy platforms fall short, it is functional, has tons of customers, and is a reasonable choice when looking for a product that handles travel plus expense management.
And those words are key  
expense management
.
So many of today s travel platforms are really expense platforms that bolt on travel as an afterthought, making travel a second class citizen to the overall product experience.
And again, in the spirit of honesty, submitting an expense report for work
isn t that complicated
. Especially when compared to the complexity and ever changing nature of business travel.
Rather than starting with building an expense platform, we turned the product development process on its head and started with building the easiest, fastest way to book travel for meetings and events.
We set out to solve the hardest problem first.
How do you empower companies to easily manage travel for their next team offsite or incentive trip? The answer(s) to this question also answer what makes AllFly corporate travel booking platform, Quest so special .
It all starts with  Events 
Inside of Quest, we built the concept of an Event. In talking with customers, often travel for meetings & events accounts for over 50% of total travel spend. Traveling for meetings is different from booking everyday transient business travel.
Creating an  event  allows company travel managers to do a few magical things:
Manage which users are eligible to attend the event
Create permissions around guest travel, including who pays for the guest
Enforce event level travel policy
Get event level reports, including arrival and departure lists
Bleisure travel is hear to stay
Although we don t love the word  bleisure  it is certainly a trend that is here to stay. Employees are extending business trips and taking some personal time, often bringing along loved ones and families.
This trend needs to be supported inside of travel products.
Quest has a series of controls that allow companies the ability to approve or reject trip extensions.
Guest & un-profiled travelers are handled with ease
Expense platforms like Concur don t even allow you to shop flights for more than 1 person. Platforms that are built for expense management first don t have the concept of a guest.
In 1999, John from sales simply went on his business trip for 2 days, came home, uploaded receipts, and was reimbursed. In 2023, businesses travel in a whole new way. The company offsite, the President s Club trip, they often make room for employees to let a guest tag along.
Inside of travel products, guests need to be labeled, identified, and empowered.
With AllFly Quest, we built a flexible ecosystem and set of controls that make guests first class citizens inside the platform.

Why you should ticket your group early

Kenny Totten
Normally, most group contracts allow you to delay group ticketing up until 30 days prior to travel. Our most savvy group travel planners ticket their groups early.
If you booked a group contract, chances are your ticketing deadline is somewhere between 30-45 days prior to travel. When booking airfare, finally receiving your ticket unlocks more flexibility for the passenger.
Once the PNR is created, passengers can view and manage their tickets on the airline s app and website.
At the 30 days prior to travel, it's not uncommon for 50-70% of the plane to be sold. Waiting to ticket gives passengers less ability to upgrade seats and move about the cabin. Here is a United flight searched on Nov 1, flying on Dec 1 (30 days prior to travel).
Screenshot of a seat map of a United Airlines flight, 30 days prior to travel
This level of availability is fairly normal at this stage. The more popular the route combined with a busier time of year, we would urge groups who are looking to upgrade their flight experience to pay their final balance and ticket early.

Why you shouldn t book airfare more than 7 months from departure
When booking group space, timing affects cost. However, optimizing for price may not always be the smartest idea, based on group size and destination.
Kenny Totten
The early bird gets the worm.
Or so the saying goes.
This popular adage couldn t be further from the truth when booking airfare.
For context, we purchase airfare on behalf of a wide range of clients, including tour operators, meeting planners, sports teams and companies. Often, our customers will book large blocks of space on a plane.
Since there is a need to secure the seats on a plane, our customers will often book 7-11 months in advance of the date of departure. When buying airfare, especially in a group, you have a tough choice. You can optimize for one of two things:
Ensuring you get space on the plane
Optimizing for price
If your group size is less than 50 passengers, we recommend waiting to book flights. There are a few reasons for this.
First, you need an understanding on how fares get loaded. Nine out of ten times, the fares available for purchase are extremely high outside of 7 months prior to departure. The airlines have a lot of data science around demand and know the current consumer behavior is to book flights much closer to travel.
There is no advantage for airlines to discount the fares far out from purchase, so customers who book well in advance often end up paying a higher price. Once the airline sees that they didn t sucker anyone into booking the higher fares, they will lower price in order to begin to fill out the plane.
An airline generally sells between 85-88% of their total seats on a plane and they have a lot of good historical data on certain routes.
With that said, airlines run a low margin business and they often will lower fares as travel gets closer to attempt to sell as many seats as possible.
The second reason we recommend waiting to book flights is the dreaded schedule change, which has been happening with increasing frequency.
If you are looking at a flight 7-11 months from departure, there is an extremely high likelihood this flight will change. Airlines are constantly changing flight schedules.
I feel victim it the dreaded schedule change in the Spring. I booked Boston to Halifax 6 months prior to travel for a golf trip. The route didn t sell well, so about 2 months prior to travel, the airline simply canceled the direct flight and rebooked me.
This also happens with groups, and the larger your group is the more painful the rebooking process is.
With all that said, if your flight is capacity challenged, meaning there are limited seats relative to your group size, go ahead and forget optimizing for price. Book the space.
If your group is relatively small compared to the size of the plane, go ahead and wait for prices to drop.
Here are some example of flights and what we would recommend:
EWR to MCO
March 10 - March 15 (Spring Break)
40 passengers
Recommendation: on popular routes, like during Spring Break, go ahead and grab the space. Don t optimize for price, the demand is so high, you need to act quickly.
LAX to DFW
May 21 - may 15 (Spring Break)
35 passengers
Recommendation: no reason to rush on this flight, this plane will likely be something comparable to a 737 and will seat 170 passengers. This means up to 50% of the plane will be available for groups. Wait it out and keep an eye on price.
JFK to FCO
July 3 - July 10
70 passengers
Recommendation: this is a pretty large group on a popular route during the summer. We would recommend booking this space early and not chancing losing out of the space.

Your Points are Safe with American Airlines
American Airlines is rethinking its strategy of linking loyalty points to NDC bookings.
Molly Lombardo
American Airlines has decided to rethink its strategy of tying loyalty points in its AAdvantage program to New Distribution Capability (NDC) bookings.
This shift comes after CEO Robert Isom acknowledged at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference that the airline's rapid implementation of its NDC ticket sales strategy contributed to disappointing second-quarter numbers.
American Airlines experienced a decline in bookings due to the hastily implemented sales and distribution strategy. Isom admitted that the airline needs to re-evaluate its distribution strategy comprehensively to address this issue.
He emphasized the importance of modern retailing and internet-based channels for the future of airline distribution but recognized that the company's swift transition to NDC was poorly executed.
Although the specifics of the new strategy were not detailed, Isom highlighted the airline's commitment to adapting its approach to regain customers lost since the change was announced in February.
Additionally, American Airlines announced that Vasu Raja, its executive vice president and Chief Commercial Officer (CCO), would step down from his role in June. A search for his replacement, led by Stephen Johnson, the vice chair and chief strategy officer, is underway.
What This Means for Travelers
For travelers, this shift means that American Airlines is re-evaluating how it manages loyalty points and ticket sales. The initial strategy to tie AAdvantage points to NDC bookings aimed to modernize the sales process and utilize internet-based channels. However, the rapid implementation caused disruptions and dissatisfaction among customers and travel agencies.
As American Airlines works on a new approach, travelers can expect the airline to focus on more balanced and thoughtful integration of modern distribution methods.
This reassessment aims to enhance the booking experience and ensure that loyalty points are easily accessible, regardless of how tickets are purchased.
Impact on Travel Agencies
The travel agency community played a significant role in American Airlines' decision to pull back on its NDC strategy.
The rapid pace of the initial move was a major concern for the American Society of Travel Advisors (ASTA), which opposed the change. Travel advisors are essential in facilitating air travel, and their advocacy helped highlight the challenges posed by the initial strategy.
With the new strategy, travel agencies can expect better communication and collaboration with American Airlines.
The airline's willingness to re-evaluate its approach indicates an understanding of the critical role that travel advisors play in the distribution channel. This collaboration will likely lead to a more integrated and mutually beneficial relationship between airlines and travel agencies.
Looking Ahead
American Airlines has not yet detailed its revised strategy, but the airline is committed to being attentive to the marketplace and optimizing its approach for customers.
ASTA has expressed openness to working with American to develop a sales strategy that incorporates NDC while considering the interests of travel agencies.
This development highlights the dynamic nature of airline distribution and the importance of collaboration between airlines and travel agencies.
As American Airlines refines its strategy, the focus will be on creating a seamless and customer-friendly booking experience. The travel agency community will continue to play a vital role in ensuring customer satisfaction and facilitating air travel in this evolving industry.

Two solutions for event booking
You have two options when partnering with AllFly to address your travel needs. Most clients choose to have AllFly create their company a customized online booking platform, which can be distributed to attendees via a unique link. We also offer a white glove service-- some clients opt for our agents to contact travelers directly or book flights off a registration list.
Which way ever you choose, the AllFly experience is backed by a wonderful service team that is with you every step of your trip.
Agent driven bookings
Call it "old school," call it "white glove service," if you wish to have our agent team interact directly with travelers we can certainly go that route. There are two flavors of agent-assisted bookings.
First, we can email flight in-policy options to your attendees.
Second, should you want to limit choice and control spend on your trip, you can give our team a list of attendees and have our agent team book the best available option.
Online booking tool - AllFly Quest
Most companies opt to use our online booking tool (Quest) to have their attendees browse in-policy flights and make a selection that best suits their individual travel preference. Once your company has an account, you can distribute access to Quest by sending a unique link to your attendees. AllFly Meetings is custom built by our in-house development team and is packed with features that meet the needs of the modern business traveler. These include:
Guest bookings
Advance flight shopping
Discount codes
Social bookings (we display how many people at your company have booked certain flights)
Split payment for upgrades
Split payment for deviations
Live arrival and departure reports
24/7 customer support
If there is ever an issue, or a traveler needs assistance, they can quickly contact our team.
Getting started with AllFly
We kick off each new event with a brief introduction and demo of the product. During this call, we confirm all of the details of your trip. These include:
Trip name
Destination
Travel dates
Estimated attendee count
Arrival and departure time restrictions
Travel policy (flight caps, approvals, class of service)
We do provide each client a demo of AllFly Quest, answering any questions along the way.
Once the demo is over, we follow up with an email and ask you to provide a list of attendees via Google Sheets, Excel, or CSV. In that list, please include:
Legal name
Email
Home city (if possible please list the home airport, but we can work with city and state)
How billing works
We bill two times during the trip process.
First, prior booking travel, we require the company to submit a per passenger deposit. Typically, for domestic travelers, the per passenger deposit is $350. Once the deposit is collected, we will book flights against the total collected amount. 95% of the trips, we go over the deposit. In the rare case that we spend less on flight than the amount we collect, we simply return the unused funds.
Once we have all of the flights booked, we will issue a final invoice.
Companies typically enjoy our billing process and it prevents having to reimburse all of the travelers individually.
Product Demo
How we help companies save money
We understand that in the current environment, every dollars counts. With that said, we do balance cost with value. From the inception of our company, we have always aimed to provide the best possible travel experience, period.
Over the years, we ve watched other travel management companies mail it in on their clients. The large players treat smaller clients as just another number in a spread sheet and aim to provide service that is  just good enough. 
We ve seen this and built the opposite force into our business. When you book with AllFly, we constantly look for ways to optimize your program. Here are some of them:
When possible, we book group contracts to help save money. Group contracts require 10+ passengers to be on the same flight. They offer a bunch of awesome benefits, like delayed final payments and free name changes.
We set up meeting contracts with various airlines. This provides 2%-10% off ticket prices depending on route, time of year, and class of service.
We provide free cancellations on Delta, American, and United. Should you cancel on any of these airlines, we refund the amount of the ticket, minus a $50 penalty. Normally, when passengers cancel, that credit sits on the passengers account, making that money good as gone.
When booking inside of AllFly Meetings, we show the passengers what flights their colleagues are on (we protect their privacy though, so we just show a count). This encourages people to arrive at the same time, which streamlines ground transportation.
Discounted international business fares. When flying international business, we can offer up to 30% off select flights.
Streamlined accounting. By billing the estimated flight amount prior to the onset of booking, we simplify accounting.
How does support work?
The level of white glove service we provide our customers is a point of pride at AllFly. We offer 24/7 phone support to all of our customers.
During business hours (Monday-Friday: 9am-6pm), we can be reached:
After hours, we can be reached at:
We can always be reached by email:
meetings@allfly.io
Payment and pricing
Let s cut to the chase. We charge $35 per passenger. Typically, our clients report up to a 15% savings when using AllFly.
Frequently Asked Questions
Will our travelers get points?
Yes. There will be two opportunities for attendees to put in their airline loyalty points, during account creation and then again at checkout.
Can travelers upgrade and pay the difference?
Yes. Should the company authorize main cabin, but the traveler wants to book business class, we bill the traveler directly the difference in fare. For example, say Main Cabin is $400 but first class is $1,200  we would bill the company $400 and the traveler $800.
Can the traveler bring a guest?
Yes. We can also split bill for the guest.
Can travelers upgrade using their points?
Typically yes, but travelers must upgrade after they receive their tickets from AllFly. This functionality varies from airline to airline.
When needs to cancel, what's the process?
Travelers wishing to change or cancel their flights will need to contact one of our team members to initiate the chance.

Navigating Travel Disruptions: Your Rights and Tips
Business travel fraught with disruptions? Know your rights! Avoid stress and frustration by understanding your options when flights are canceled or delayed. Stay informed and prepared.
Kenny Totten
Traveling for business can be a challenging experience, especially when faced with unexpected cancellations, delays, and disruptions. Understanding your rights as a traveler is crucial in navigating these situations effectively. This resource outlines your rights and provides practical tips to help you manage travel disruptions with major U.S.-based airlines such as Delta, United, American, Southwest, and JetBlue.
Understanding Airline Policies
Before diving into specific scenarios, it s important to understand that each airline has its own policies regarding cancellations, delays, and disruptions. Checking the specific policy of your airline can give you a better idea of what to expect and what you are entitled to in case of an issue.
Airline Loyalty Program Benefits During Disruptions
Delta SkyMiles members often enjoy enhanced benefits when facing flight cancellations, delays, or disruptions. While specific perks can vary based on membership tier, here's a general overview:
Priority Rebooking:
Higher-tier members typically have priority access to rebooking options, ensuring faster assistance and potentially better flight alternatives.
Dedicated Customer Service:
Medallion members often have access to dedicated customer service lines, providing quicker resolutions to issues.
Lounge Access:
Members with lounge access can relax in a comfortable environment while waiting for flight updates.
Waived Change Fees:
In some cases, Medallion members may be exempt from change fees, offering more flexibility during disruptions.
Compensation:
While not guaranteed, higher-tier members might receive additional compensation or amenities, such as hotel vouchers or priority baggage handling.
American Airlines AAdvantage members receive similar benefits:
Priority Assistance:
Higher-tier members often receive priority assistance from airport agents, expediting the rebooking process.
Lounge Access:
Access to Admirals Clubs can provide a comfortable space to wait out delays and access to customer service representatives.
Waived Change Fees:
Depending on the membership tier, change fees may be waived, offering greater flexibility.
Priority Baggage Handling:
AAdvantage members often receive priority handling for checked baggage, reducing the risk of lost or delayed luggage during disruptions.
Compensation:
While not guaranteed, elite members might be eligible for additional compensation or amenities.
Southwest Airlines offers several benefits to customers whose flights are disrupted, including rebooking, refunds, and vouchers:
Rebooking:
Southwest will rebook customers on the next available flight at no extra cost if the disruption is within their control, such as mechanical issues or aircraft swaps.
Refunds:
Customers can request a refund for the unused portion of their ticket if they choose not to travel due to a significant delay or cancellation. They can also request a refund for unused ground transportation, accommodations, and activities booked through Southwest Vacations.
Vouchers:
Customers may be eligible for a Southwest LUV Voucher if Southwest cancels or delays their flight less than eight days before departure, or if they arrive at their destination more than three hours late. Southwest may also consider reimbursing customers for other costs, such as meals, hotel stays, and airport wait times, if the disruption results in an overnight stay away from home or a wait time of three or more hours.
Scenario 1: Flight Canceled by Airline
When an airline cancels your flight, your rights depend on the reason for the cancellation.
Airline Issues (e.g., technical problems, staffing issues):
You're generally entitled to a full cash refund or rebooking on a later flight at no extra cost.
Airlines like Delta and United often provide meal vouchers or hotel accommodations if the cancellation requires an overnight stay.
To obtain these, speak directly with a gate agent or visit the customer service desk.
The airline's app may also provide updates, but vouchers and accommodations often require in-person assistance.
Uncontrollable Events (e.g., weather, natural disasters):
Rebooking options are more likely.
Meal and hotel vouchers are less guaranteed.
Example 1:
If your Delta flight from New York to Los Angeles is canceled due to a mechanical issue, Delta will either rebook you or offer a full refund. If the next flight is the following day, Delta is likely to provide a hotel voucher and meal vouchers.
Example 2:
If your American Airlines flight from Chicago to Miami is canceled due to a hurricane, American Airlines will prioritize rebooking but providing meal and hotel vouchers is at their discretion.
Scenario 2: Voluntary Cancellation by Passenger
Your rights and options depend on the type of ticket you purchased.
Refundable Tickets:
You can usually get a full refund without fees.
Non-refundable Tickets:
You may receive a credit for future travel minus a cancellation fee.
For example, American Airlines typically charges a fee unless you cancel within 24 hours of booking.
Delta Airlines:
Offers a 24-hour risk-free cancellation policy for most tickets.
Provides refundable ticket options.
Non-refundable tickets canceled after 24 hours may incur a fee and result in an eCredit.
United Airlines:
Allows cancellations up to 24 hours before departure for a refund, but may deduct 10% of the fare.
Offers refunds within five days if booked through their website or customer care team.
Southwest Airlines:
Allows cancellations without penalty within 24 hours of booking for a full refund.
Example 1:
If you booked a non-refundable ticket with United Airlines and need to cancel, you might receive a travel credit, but a fee of around $200 may be deducted.
Example 2:
If you book a non-refundable ticket with American Airlines and need to cancel after 24 hours, you may receive a travel credit with a cancellation fee.
Scenario 3: Overbooking
When an airline overbooks a flight, it can lead to involuntary bumping.
Compensation:
If you are involuntarily bumped, airlines must compensate you. For instance, United might offer up to $1,350 depending on the delay caused by the bump. You will typically receive this compensation at the gate or customer service desk.
Voluntary Bumping:
If you volunteer to give up your seat, you can negotiate compensation, which often includes travel vouchers or cash. This process usually happens at the gate where agents announce the need for volunteers.
Example 1:
If you are bumped from an overbooked Delta flight, Delta is required to compensate you. The amount varies but can be significant if the next available flight causes a long delay. Speak with the gate agent to receive your compensation.
Example 2:
If your American Airlines flight from Miami to London is delayed overnight due to a mechanical issue, and you're not flying to your home city, American Airlines will likely provide you with:* A voucher for an approved hotel with available rooms.* Transportation to the hotel and back to the airport, either by a hotel shuttle or a voucher for reasonable transportation costs (e.g., taxi fare).
Additional Information:
Conditions:
American's policy clarifies that these vouchers are for "approved hotels with available rooms" and "if you are delayed overnight if you're away from your city of residence." This means they might not offer a voucher if there are no rooms available or if you're already in your home city.
Transportation:
American will also provide transportation to and from the hotel, either by a hotel shuttle, a third-party service, or a voucher for reasonable transportation costs.
Meal Vouchers:
As you mentioned, these are offered for delays exceeding 3 hours, not just overnight delays.
United Airlines Premier members:
may call the Premier Priority Desk to confirm and verify alternative re-accommodation when their travel plans are interrupted by a delay, cancellation or flight diversion. In some cases, the ticket agent may be required to endorse the Premier member's ticket before beginning their next flight.
Scenario 4: Missed Connections
If you miss a connection due to a delay on the first leg of your journey:
Rebooking:
The airline should rebook you on the next available flight. This can be done through the airline s app, but it is often more effective to speak directly with a gate agent or customer service representative.
Accommodations:
If the missed connection results in an overnight stay, airlines like American typically provide hotel accommodations and meal vouchers. Obtain these by speaking with a gate agent or customer service desk.
Example:
If your American Airlines flight from Dallas to New York is delayed, causing you to miss your connecting flight to Boston, American should rebook you on the next available flight and provide accommodations if necessary. Speak with a gate agent to arrange this.
Scenario 5: Delayed Baggage
If your checked baggage fails to arrive at your destination with you:
Tracking:
Most airlines offer baggage tracking services. You can use the airline's app or website to track your bag's location.
Contacting the Airline:
Reach out to the airline's baggage services as soon as you realize your bag is missing. They will initiate a search and provide you with a claim number.
Compensation:
While not guaranteed, some airlines may provide compensation for essential items needed while waiting for your luggage.
Example:
If your Delta flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles arrives on time but your checked bag does not, use the Delta app to track your bag. If it's not located, contact Delta's baggage services to report the missing bag and obtain a claim number.
United Airlines offers a free bag delivery if the baggage is delayed.
Scenario 6: Lost or Damaged Baggage
If your checked baggage is lost or damaged:
Reporting the Issue:
Immediately report the lost or damaged bag to the airline's baggage services at the airport.
Documentation:
Provide detailed information about the bag, its contents, and any damage. Photos of the bag and its contents can be helpful.
Compensation:
The airline may offer compensation for lost or damaged items. It's essential to keep all receipts for purchases made to replace lost items.
Example:
If your American Airlines flight arrives in Chicago and you discover your suitcase is damaged, report the damage to the airline's baggage services at the airport. Take photos of the damage and keep receipts for any repairs or replacements.
Delta offers a clear process for reporting and claiming compensation for delayed, lost, or damaged baggage.
Key points include:
File Reference Number: This is essential for tracking and processing claims.
Baggage Fee Rebate: Delta offers a rebate for delayed checked bags if they are not located within 12 hours.
Compensation: While not guaranteed, Delta may provide compensation for essential items purchased due to delayed baggage.
Damaged Baggage: Must be reported immediately and evaluated by a Delta representative.
Claim Submission: Delta provides an online form for submitting baggage claims.
With United Airlines, if the bag cannot be found in 5 days, the lost bag claim should be filled out and reimbursed expenses will be deducted from the final payout if the bag is permanently lost.
For domestic flights, Southwest customers must notify customer support of the loss, damage, or delay within four hours of either: (a) flight arrival or (b) baggage receipt, whichever is applicable.
Additional Notes:
Time Limits:
It's important to emphasize the time limits for reporting damaged baggage (24 hours for domestic, 7 days for international travel).
Documentation:
Encourage passengers to keep all receipts and documentation related to the baggage issue.
Passenger Rights:
Briefly mention that passengers may have additional rights under specific regulations (e.g., EU261) regarding baggage compensation.
American offers a clear process for reporting and claiming compensation for delayed, lost, or damaged baggage.
Key points include:
QR Code Reporting: American Airlines offers a convenient QR code system for reporting delayed or damaged bags.
Timely Reporting: Strict deadlines for reporting delayed or damaged bags are in place.
File Reference Number: A file reference number is generated for tracking purposes.
Missing Contents: American Airlines does not accept liability for missing items unless the bag was reported as delayed or damaged.
American Airlines Deadlines for Reporting Baggage Issues
Delayed Bags
Domestic flights: Report within 4 hours of arriving at your destination.
International flights: Report before leaving the airport.
Damaged Bags for American Airlines flights
Domestic flights: Report before leaving the airport or within 24 hours of receiving your bags.
International flights: Report before leaving the airport or within 7 days of receiving your bags.
Missing Items for American Airlines flights
Domestic flights: Report within 24 hours of receiving your bag if it was previously reported as delayed or damaged.
International flights: Report within 7 days of receiving your bag if it was previously reported as delayed or damaged.
Missing items for United Airlines:
Report missing items and get a file reference number as soon as possible.
If the items went missing during a security screening, you should file a written claim with the TSA (or call TSA Contact Center at 1-866-289-9673)
Damaged Bags for Southwest Airlines flights:
Domestic flights: Report within 4 hours of flight arrival.
International flights: Report within 7 days of receiving your bags.
JetBlue s liability for loss, for travel entirely within the USA, damage or delay in delivery of baggage is limited to $3,800 per ticketed passenger unless a higher value is declared in advance and additional charges are paid.
JetBlue offers shipping the delayed bag to either a permanent or temporary address. Your bag will be delivered to the address listed on your claim.
Scenario 7: Weather-Related Disruptions
Compensation for weather-related issues is limited.
Rebooking:
Airlines will typically rebook you on the next available flight, but additional compensation is rare. Use the airline s app or speak with a gate agent for rebooking.
Meal Vouchers:
Some airlines might offer meal vouchers, but this is not guaranteed. It s worth asking a gate agent or customer service representative.
Example:
If a snowstorm causes your Southwest flight to be canceled, Southwest will rebook you on the next available flight but may not provide additional compensation. Check the app for updates and speak with a gate agent for assistance.
Scenario 8: Strikes and Labor Actions
Labor actions can severely disrupt schedules.
Rebooking:
Airlines will typically rebook you on another flight. Check the airline s app for updates or speak with a gate agent.
Compensation:
Varies by airline and situation. Ask the gate agent or customer service representative about your options.
Example:
If a strike affects your JetBlue flight, JetBlue will rebook you but additional compensation may not be available. Speak with a gate agent for details.
Scenario 9: Security Issues
Security issues can lead to cancellations or delays.
Rebooking:
Airlines are required to rebook you on the next available flight. Use the airline s app or speak with a gate agent for rebooking.
Compensation:
Depends on the specific situation. Ask the gate agent or customer service representative for details.
Example:
If a security alert cancels your Delta flight, Delta will rebook you on the next available flight. Check the app for updates and speak with a gate agent for assistance.
Section 10: How to Claim Your Rights
Immediate Steps:Stay calm, gather information, and contact the airline. Use the airline's app for real-time updates and rebooking options.
Documentation:Keep all receipts, boarding passes, and records of communication. These are crucial for reimbursement claims.
Customer Service:Approach customer service calmly and assertively. Clearly state your needs and know your rights to ensure you receive proper assistance.
Example:If your United flight is canceled, use the United app to find rebooking options and approach the customer service desk with all relevant documentation to expedite the process.
Conclusion
Knowing your rights as a traveler can significantly ease the stress of flight cancellations, delays, and disruptions. By staying informed and prepared, you can handle these situations with confidence and ensure you receive the compensation and assistance you deserve.
For further assistance, always refer to your airline's specific policies and contact their customer service for help.
By understanding and asserting your rights, you can turn a potentially frustrating travel experience into a manageable situation. Safe travels!

Planning group travel with Southwest Airlines offers a unique set of benefits and considerations. Group travel can be an exciting adventure, whether you're planning a corporate retreat or a getaway to Miami. When it comes to organizing group travel, understanding how Southwest Airlines Group Travel works is important.
 
Group Travel with Southwest
 
Southwest Airlines provides a convenient way for travel organizers to secure 10 or more seats on a plane while postponing the full payment. Traditionally, customers would call Southwest directly to request pricing and initiate the process of holding space.
 
However, for those who don t want to wait on hold forever and prefer the ease of online booking, AllFly Marketplace offers a seamless platform that compares group contract rates from various airlines, including Southwest, to streamline group travel booking process.
 
Southwest Airlines Group vs Meeting Contracts
 
Southwest's group and meeting contracts serve distinct purposes. Group contracts are ideal for scenarios where 10 or more passengers need seats on the same Southwest Airlines flight. Meeting contracts, on the other hand, provide discount codes for individuals to use when booking their Southwest Airlines flights.
 
Southwest Business Meetings is a better fit than a group contract for 25 or more travelers flying from different locations to the same destination. With meeting contracts, travelers have the freedom to choose their preferred flights and enter their discount code at checkout.
 
What if you don t have a minimum of 25 travelers for Southwest Business Meetings? AllFly created a one stop shop for you! We have built a platform called AllFly Quest that allows groups of ideally 10 or more travelers coming from different locations and arriving at the same destination to book their own flights under one corporate payment account with meetings discounts applied automatically at checkout.
 
Here's a Brief Overview of Some of Southwest s Travel Policies with Group Contracts:
 
Minimum Group Size:
Southwest requires a minimum of ten passengers to qualify for group travel.
Deposit:
A $50 per traveler deposit is required at the time of booking, with the full payment due closer to the departure date. Deposits are
not
applied towards the purchase of the ticket and will be refunded five business days after final payment and ticketing.
Payment:
After submitting a complete name list, payment can be made by calling or emailing Southwest at least seven business days before the final payment due date.
Finalizing Details:
Southwest allows unlimited name changes up to 72 hours before departure, providing flexibility for group members.
Free Tour Conductor Ticket:
For every 29 Group tickets purchased, one Tour Conductor ticket will be provided free of carrier charge.
You also get
two
free checked bags!
 
AllFly: Your One-Stop Solution for Group Travel:
 
Now that you understand some of Southwest's Group Contract Travel Policies, let's explore a little more about how AllFly can enhance your group travel experience. AllFly Marketplace and AllFly Quest serve as centralized booking platforms that streamline the entire corporate group travel booking process, ensuring a hassle-free experience from start to finish. No more calling the airline and waiting on hold!
 
AllFly Marketplace:
AllFly's Marketplace is our one stop shop for booking group travel and allows you to access group pricing from various airlines, including Southwest.
AllFly Quest:
AllFly Quest is our airfare booking platform built specifically for corporate meetings and events where travelers can book their flights on their own under one corporate payment account and have meeting contracts applied automatically on the back end.
Dedicated Account Managers:
AllFly's dedicated account managers are committed to making your Southwest group travel experience seamless. Our experienced team will assist you in navigating the complexities of group bookings, ensuring compliance with Southwest policies and maximizing cost-effectiveness.
24/7 Customer Service:
AllFly provides round-the-clock support to address any concerns or changes that may arise during the planning and execution of your group flight.
 
Navigating group travel with Southwest Airlines requires a careful understanding of the airline's group travel policies. Southwest Airlines combined with the convenience of AllFly's Marketplace and AllFly Quest, offer a comprehensive solution for group travelers going to a corporate meeting or event.
Simplify your group travel experience by leveraging the expertise and efficiency of AllFly, ensuring that your journey on Southwest Airlines is as enjoyable and stress-free as possible.

The Death of White Glove Delivery for Corporate Travel
Molly Lombardo
Jul 19, 2024
14
minutes of reading
Background
A sustainable building materials manufacturer with 300 employees spread across the East Coast needed to arrange travel for an upcoming conference.
Challenge
Using the traditional method of email exchanges with a travel agent from previous smaller trips, the company estimated booking white-glove travel for all 300 employees across the East Coast would take 600 days. This translates to an average of 2 days per employee (600 days / 300 employees). This approach caused several issues:
Excessive Time Consumption: Booking a single trip involved multiple emails and approvals, leading to delays. On average, booking 300 employee trips took 600 days.
Hidden Costs: The company wasn't accessing the latest deals due to limitations of the travel agent's platform. Internal estimates suggested an average cost increase of $50 per ticket compared to online booking tools.
Frustration and Errors: Back-and-forth communication increased the risk of mistakes. Missed emails or misinterpretations occasionally led to incorrect bookings, causing additional stress.
Limited Travel Visibility: Tracking booked flights and expenses relied on manual reports from the travel agent. This made it difficult to monitor travel spend or identify cost-saving opportunities.
Solution
This company implemented AllFly, a user-friendly online travel booking tool.
Impact
Faster Booking: Streamlined process allowed employees to find and book flights quickly.
Cost Savings: By accessing the latest fares through AllFly, the company achieved an estimated average saving of $30 per ticket compared to the old method. For 10 bookings, this meant a saving of $300. So, booking 300 flights through AllFly results in an estimated total saving of $9,000 compared to the old method.
Reduced Errors: The user-friendly interface and automated features minimized communication errors and ensured accurate bookings.
Improved Visibility: Real-time tracking of booked flights and expenses allowed GreenTech to gain better control over travel costs and make strategic decisions.
Employee Feedback
:
"AllFly is so much easier to use than emailing back-and-forth. I can quickly compare options and book flights myself, saving everyone time." - Sarah L., Head of Human Resources
"Being able to see all the travel expenses in one place is really helpful for budgeting and planning." - John M., Head of Global Events
 
Conclusion
By switching from outdated "white glove service" to AllFly, the company achieved significant improvements in efficiency, cost savings, and employee satisfaction. AllFly not only streamlined the travel booking process but also provided greater transparency and control over travel expenses.

Streamlining Group Travel with AllFly Marketplace
Molly Lombardo
Jul 19, 2024

minutes of reading
Background
A high school ice hockey sports team from Texas experienced a milestone year, clinching victory in the championship game within their high school division. This marked a significant period for many team members, as they actively sought opportunities with various colleges. The prospect of scouting opportunities heightened when rumors circulated about a major tournament in France, anticipated to attract numerous scouts from prominent universities. The potential impact of this opportunity was invaluable for the future endeavors of the teammates.
The Challenge
Sports teams, especially ones that feature minors, need to guarantee they all fly on the same flight. Currently, almost all airlines limit you to booking 6 to 9 passengers on the same record. Also, the airline requires you to pay in full when purchasing published fare tickets from their website.
This high school hockey team needed a fast and easy way to secure 30 seats on a plane, all at once while delaying payment. The team also has budget constraints, so calling 3-4 airlines and waiting days to get a quote from the airline group desk is a non-starter.
The Solution
The tour operator found AllFly by searching for group travel management companies online. What caught their attention was the user-friendly marketplace for searching group flights. Immediately, they noticed that instead of calling the airline group desk for an over the phone quote, they could simply shop only, like they do for a single ticket.
One notable aspect for the tour operator was AllFly's ability to automate many offline processes, eliminating the hindrances that typically slow down business operations. Additionally, the dedicated account manager assigned to them stood out. AllFly's team seamlessly integrated into their operations, promoting efficiency and generating cost savings for the tour operator.
The Impact

Travel Agents Cost Companies Extra on Flights
Molly Lombardo
Jul 19, 2024
14
minutes of reading
Background
Traditional travel booking methods are costing companies up to $140 extra per ticket on corporate travel, according to a new study by AllFly.
The average time taken to book a trip through email or phone calls was 122% longer than an online booking platform.
Post-ticketing service needs are 28% higher for white glove bookings, indicating more delays and potential disruptions.
Challenge
Global business travel spend is set to surpass pre-pandemic levels in 2024, two years sooner than previously forecasted, according to the GBTA s Business Travel Index Outlook report. The amount spent on corporate trips rose 47% to $1.03 trillion in 2022 and is expected to grow a further 32% in 2023. However, traditional travel booking methods, like emailing a travel agent or calling in for flight options, are costing companies up to $140 extra per ticket on corporate travel, according to a new study by leading online travel booking platform AllFly.And with an average business trip involving a group of 25, this means an overspend of $3,500.
The study, which analyzed 100 group travel programs, revealed that these more traditional methods, often referred to as "white glove service", result in significantly higher costs compared to online booking. The average ticket booked through white glove service came in 17% higher at a staggering $523, compared to $436 for online booking. The study, which analyzed 100 group travel programs, revealed that these more traditional methods, often referred to as "white glove service", result in significantly higher costs compared to online booking. The average ticket booked through white glove service came in 17% higher at a staggering $523, compared to $436 for online booking.
Kenny Totten, COO at AllFly, explains:  One of the primary reasons why using these traditional methods tends to be much more expensive is the type of technology used. Sabre and Amadeus are the two most popular Global Distribution Systems (GDS) used by travel agencies.
However, many of the world s most popular airlines, such as American and United, are increasingly withholding their best fares from these GDS, opting instead to offer them through their own New Distribution Capability (NDC) channels or direct bookings.This means that companies relying on white glove service or manual, offline bookings may be missing out on substantial savings.
American and United account for up to 50% of our corporate travel bookings in some programs. Considering these airlines holding back their best fares from the GDS, it's clear that the white glove service is leaving significant money on the table. In these scenarios, upwards of 50 people per program could be paying as much as $140 more per ticket - a cost no company can afford in today's competitive landscape. Beyond cost, the study also highlighted the inefficiencies of white glove service. The average time spent booking a program through email or phone calls was 20 days, while online booking took only 9 days. Not only is this inconvenient for all involved, but the extended time gap between sourcing flights and completing the booking increases the chance of losing a good deal. While time is spent emailing or calling back and forth, deals can be snapped up and then you are back to stage one.
Additionally, post-ticketing service needs (the services and support required after booking) were found to be 28% higher for white glove bookings, indicating more delays and potential disruptions. The data speaks for itself: white glove service is outdated, expensive, and inefficient. In 2024, there's no reason companies should be stuck in the travel booking dark ages. Modern online platforms offer faster, cheaper, and more transparent booking experiences while keeping travelers empowered to find the best deals for themselves.
Solution
By transitioning to online platforms, companies can unlock significant cost savings, streamline booking processes, and empower their employees for a more enjoyable and efficient travel experience.
AllFly s online booking platform, Quest, is a modern take on legacy online booking tools. Quest is built for companies who often travel for team offsites, meetings, and events. AllFly is a venture-backed, corporate travel management platform that makes it easy for organizations to plan, book, and manage their everyday business and event travel. It is committed to helping companies save money, reduce complexity, and create unforgettable travel experiences for their employees.

Letting Employees Book Themselves for a Corporate Offsite
Molly Lombardo
Jul 19, 2024
14
minutes of reading
Company: A software startup with a culture of employee empowerment.
Solution: The company established a travel budget and broad guidelines for flights and hotels. Employees were trusted to book their own travel arrangements within these parameters.
Challenge: To create a more engaging work environment, the company decided to host a team-building offsite. Inspired by the desire to empower employees and streamline travel processes, they opted for a self-booking travel program.
Results:
Cost Overruns: Despite the budget, overall travel expenses soared by 20%. Employees, unfamiliar with corporate travel best practices, booked premium cabins and higher-end hotels, exceeding per diem rates for meals.
Missed Flights and Delays: Several employees, overwhelmed by personal travel schedules, neglected to book return flights, leading to last-minute scrambles and additional costs.
HR Overload: The program placed a significant burden on the HR coordinator managing the offsite. Resolving booking errors, managing budget overruns, and fielding employee questions consumed a large portion of her time.
Employee Resentment: Stricter expense report reviews after the trip caused frustration among employees who felt micromanaged after being trusted with booking their travel.
Lesson Learned: Streamlining Travel with AllFly
The company's self-booked travel program highlighted the importance of a structured approach to corporate travel. While some employees may crave the convenience of booking their own flights and hotels, prioritizing personal points and rewards can lead to issues like exceeding budgets and neglecting travel policies.
 
The AllFly Solution:
This experience prompted the company to explore AllFly, a corporate travel management software designed to address the challenges encountered. Here's how AllFly can benefit.
 
TechSurge:
Simplified Booking: AllFly offers a user-friendly platform that streamlines the booking process for employees, saving time and reducing booking errors. This eliminates the burden of independent research while maintaining a level of convenience.
Policy Enforcement: AllFly allows companies to set clear travel policies and ensures employees book within budget limitations. Pre-negotiated rates and flight options guarantee cost-effectiveness while offering a curated selection that adheres to company guidelines.
Centralized Management: AllFly provides a central hub for managing all travel arrangements. This eliminates the administrative burden on HR, allowing them to focus on other aspects of the offsite experience.
Duty of Care: With AllFly, the company can easily track employee locations throughout the trip. This is crucial for ensuring employee safety in case of emergencies and provides peace of mind for the company.
Use of Points & Rewards: Travelers can still take advantage of airline loyalty programs & rewards.
 
Conclusion:
The start-up's experience demonstrates the need for a balance between employee autonomy and cost-effective travel management. AllFly offers a solution that promotes streamlined booking, policy adherence, and employee safety, resulting in a smoother and more successful corporate travel experience for all involved.
